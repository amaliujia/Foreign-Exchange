1. INTRODUCTION
Quinoline derivatives represent the major class of heterocycles, and a number of preparations have been known since the late 1980s. The quinoline skeleton is often used for the
design of many synthetic compounds with diverse pharmacological properties. Dynemicin A and Streptonigrin are naturally
occurring members of the class of antitumor antibiotics, whose syntheses are based on the utilization of preformed quinoline derivatives []. The
8-(diethylaminohexylamino)-6-methoxy-4-methyl-quinoline is highly effective against the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which is the agent of Chagas disease [] and the 2-(2-methylquinolin-4-ylamino)-N-phenylacetamide is more active
than the standard antileishmanial drug sodium antimony gluconate []. The centipede, Scolopendra Subspinipes mutilalns L. KOCH, 
which is found to contain 3,8-dihydroxyquinoline called Jineol has been prescribed for tetanus and childhood convulsions []. This drug has also
been used for many other clinical purposes, such as the treatment of acute heart attack and as a toxicide in Korea 
[]. Cryptolepine (5-methyl-5H-indolol[3,2-b]quinoline)-major 
Cryptolepis sanguinolenta alkaloid displays a plenty of pharmacological effects, such as antimuscarinic,
noradrenergic receptor antagonistic, antihypertensive, vasodilative,
antithrombotic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Neocryptolepine and cryptolepine 
derivatives reveal antiplasmodial, antitrypanosomal, and first of all, cytotoxic activities [–]. 
Quinoline containing drugs, particularly 4-aminoquinolines, have a long and successful history as
antimalarials [, ].

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Analytical methods
All the chemicals used in the present study are of AR grade. 2-Chloro-3-quinolinecarbaldehyde
(Sigma-Aldrich Chemie, Germany), 2-aminophenol (S.D. Fine Chem Ltd, India), and o-Phenylenediammine 
(S.D. Fine Chem Ltd, India) were used. The metal contents of the
complexes were determined by complexometric titrations and gravimetric
estimations. The molar conductivities in DMF (10−3 M) at 
room temperature were measured using an Equiptronics digital conductivity meter. 
Magnetic susceptibilities of the solid complexes were measured employing Gouy balance 
at room temperature (28 ± 2°C) using 
Hg[Co(CNS)4], that is, 
mercury(II) tetrathiocyanato cobaltate(II), as a calibrant for standardizing the Gouy tube.

2.2. Spectral measurements
The IR spectra of ligand and its metal complexes were recorded on a Shimadzu
FTIR-8400S spectrometer with KBr pellets in the region 
250–4000 cm−1. JEOL 60 MHz 
spectrometer was used for recording the proton NMR spectra employing TMS as internal reference 
and DMSO-d6 as solvent. UV-visible spectra were measured on a Shimadzu
double beam spectrophotometer using N,N′-dimethylformamide as a solvent at 10−3 M concentration.

3. EXPERIMENTAL
3.1. Synthesis of ligand QBD by microwave irradiation
2-Chloro-3-quinolinecarbaldehyde
(0.958 g, 5 mmo1) dissolved in small amount of acetic acid was taken in a 100 ml borosil beaker. o-Phenylenediammine
(0.541 g, 5 mmol) and a pinch of potassium iodide were then added. The mixture was irradiated in a microwave
oven for about 10 minutes. The
product obtained was poured into ice-cold water, the solid separated was
filtered, dried, and recrystallized ().

3.2. Synthesis of ligand QBO by microwave irradiation
Mixture of 2-aminophenol (0.11 g, 1 mmol), KOH (0.057 g, 1 mmol), 
and 2 ml of DMSO were taken in a 100 ml borosil beaker.
2-Chloro-3-quinolinecarbaldehyde (1 mmol, 0.192 g) and a pinch of KI were then added. The mixture was irradiated for about two minutes in a microwave oven. The product obtained was then hydrolyzed by pouring into ice-cold water. The final
product separated as a solid on acidification with dilute HCl was then filtered
and dried ().

3.3. Synthesis of Cobalt(II) and Nickel(II) 
 complexes of QBD and QBO
The
ligand (10 mmol) was dissolved in a dry methanol (50 ml). A solution of the
metal chloride (5 mmol) in methanol (50 ml) was then added dropwise to the
ligand solution under nitrogen gas with continuous stirring. The mixture was refluxed for about 5
hours. The resulting precipitate was filtered
off and washed with methanol. The precipitate
was redissolved in ethanol on a water bath and the ethanol was slowly
evaporated. Further, slow evaporation of
the solution at room temperature resulted in the formation of colored
compound.

3.4. Synthesis of Cadmium(II) and Zinc(II) complexes 
 of QBD and QBO
The
ethanolic solution of a ligand (0.5 mmol) was slowly added to a 50 ml solution
of metal chloride (0.5 mmol) in ethanol with continuous stirring. The reaction mixture was warmed on a water
bath at 70 to 80°C for about 1 hour.
The precipitate obtained was filtered, washed several times with
absolute alcohol, finally with ether, and then dried over fused CaCl2.

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The
complexes are microcrystalline colored powder, stable at room temperature, and
are soluble in DMF and DMSO. The
elemental analyses were satisfactory, show that the complexes have a ligand
to metal ratio of 1 : 2 and 1 : 1, and have the general formula 
[ML2Cl2], where M=Co(II) 
or Ni(II), and [MLCl2], where 
M=Zn(II) or Cd(II); L=QBD or QBO. 
The molar 
conductance value (13.31–25.2 mhos cm2 mol−1) indicates the 
nonelectrolytic nature of the complexes ().

4.1. Electronic and reflectance spectra
The
Co(II) complexes exhibit three bands in the visible region 13310–14250 cm−1, 14810–14988 cm−1, 
and 16425–16431 cm−1 pertaining to 4T1g(F) → 4T2g(F) (ν1), 4T1g(F) → 4A2g(F) (ν2), and 4T1g(F) → 4T1g(P) (ν 3) transitions, respectively.
These electronic spectral data were consistent with high-spin octahedral
configuration around Co(II) ion [, ]. 
The electronic spectra of Ni(II) complexes of QBD and QBO show two bands
in the region 12610–16260 cm−1and 
23256–28011 cm−1 due
to 3A2g(F) → 3T1g(F) (ν2) and 3A2g(F) → 3T1g(P) (ν3) transitions, respectively, that commensurate with octahedral
stereochemistry []. The reflectance
spectra is identical for both Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes. The spectra of the complexes do not indicate lowest energy 3A2g→3T2g transition. The Zn(II) complex shows two
week low energy bands at 15155 cm−1 and 19500 cm−1. This is due to metal ligand charge transfer
process ascribed to a charge transfer from d orbital of the metal to the * system of the ligand [–]. 
The low-energy bands are in the position
typically found for square planer configuration and may be assigned to 2B1g→2A1g and 2B1g→2Eg transition, respectively. These complexes also exhibit more intense band at 37000 cm−1 which corresponds to intra ligand
molecular charge transfer within the ligand that are assigned to n → * transitions. The absence of d-d bands in
these complexes at longer wavelength is quite reasonable since the metal ion
has filled d-sub shells where d-d transitions are highly forbidden [, ]. By considering these data, the tetrahedral geometry
has 
been proposed for Cd(II) [] and square planar 
geometry for Zn(II) complexes [, ].

4.2. Magnetic moments
The
room temperature magnetic moment value () supports octahedral 
geometry for Co(II) and Ni(II) complexes. The
complexes Zn(II) and Cd(II) are
diamagnetic due to the unavailability of unpaired electrons [–, –].

4.3. IR spectra
The IR spectra of complexes are
compared with that of free ligands to determine the changes that might have
taken place during complexation. The
important bands and assignments of ligands and their complexes are summarized
in . The results indicate that
the ligands are bidentate [–] in nature.

The free
ligand QBD exhibits strong bands at 1658 and 3330 cm−1 due to C=N and −NH groups, respectively. In
the IR spectra of complexes, these bands shift (10–35 cm−1) towards the lower energies when compared with free
ligands. The characteristic absorptions
at 1650 and 1022 cm−1 in QBO were assigned to the stretching
vibrations of ν(C=N)
and ν(COC) groups, respectively. In the complexes, these vibrations shift to lower regions by 10–25 cm−1. The shift of these bands in complexes
suggests the coordination of nitrogen of quinoline ring and oxygen atom of
azepine ring of ligand to metal ions. The
bonding of metal ion to the ligands through N, N in QBD and N, O atoms in QBO
was further supported by the presence of new bands in the region 328–375 cm−1 due to ν(M−N) and ν(M−O) vibrations [–].

4.4. 1H NMR spectra
The
above binding pattern is further supported by proton magnetic resonance
spectral studies and chemical shift
values presented in . The 1H NMR spectra of
ligand QBD exhibits a singlet at 10.80 δ (s, N−H) and 8.6 δ (s,
H−C=N). The spectra of complexes slightly changed as compared to those of
corresponding ligand, and the signals appeared downfield, as expected, due to
the coordination of nitrogen atoms to the metal ion [–]. 1H NMR spectrum of QBO ligand
showed signals at δ 8.4 (s, 1H, H−C=N), 7.3–8.0 (m, 11H, Ar−H), 
and 2.6 (s, 3H, CH3). In the spectra of complexes, all signals
remained in the same position except the signal of H−C=N. This is probably due to the coordinating
effect of azepine oxygen atom.

5. BIOLOGICAL STUDIES
5.1. Antibacterial activity
The
ligands and their Co(II), Ni(II), Cd(II) and Zn(II) complexes were tested for the in vitro antibacterial activity against P. aerugenosa (gram-negative) 
and S. aureus (gram-positive) bacteria by employing paper 
disc method [–]. The antibacterial activity was estimated on
the basis of the size of inhibition zone formed around the paper discs on the
seeded agar plates. For each
concentration, the mean diameter (mm) of inhibition zone developed was
calculated. The streptomycin (100 mg)
was used as a standard and DMF solvent was also put to know the activity of
solvent.

5.2. Antifungal activity
The
antifungal studies of ligands and its metal complexes were tested on fungal
strains namely, C. albicans, A. flavus, and A. niger in
growth media by using Batemann poisoned-food technique [, ]. A known weight of the compound was dissolved
in DMF in suitably labeled sterile test tubes to get a final concentration of
0.1, 0.2, and 0.3%. The sterile medium, sterile
ligand, and metal complex solution were mixed under sterile conditions and
allowed for solidification. The Fluconazole
(100 mg) was used as a standard and DMF solvent was also put to know the
activity of solvent.

The
test fungi were taken as 2 mm discs from 10 days old pure colonies and placed
at the center of petri dishes containing nutrient medium. The experiment was carried out in four
replicates per treatment, and incubation was carried out at 30°C for
72 hours. The radial growth of colony was
recorded after 96 hours of incubation and mean diameter of mycelial growth in
each treatment was recorded. The average
percentage inhibition was calculated on the growth media compared to the
respective controls using expression [] I = (C-T) × 100/C, where I = percentage
inhibition, C = average diameter of fungal growth on the control plates, and T = average
diameter of fungal growth on the tested plates ().

Antibacterial
and antifungal data are presented in .
This screening data clearly leads to the following conclusion.
 The complexes are slightly more toxic
than their parent ligands against tested microorganisms under identical
experimental conditions.

The antimicrobial activity results
indicate that the activity of Zn(II) complexes show better activity than that
of Cd(II), Co(II), and Ni(II) complexes.

The antifungal screening data clearly
shows that the inhibition of fungal growth increases with increasing the
concentration of complexes.
