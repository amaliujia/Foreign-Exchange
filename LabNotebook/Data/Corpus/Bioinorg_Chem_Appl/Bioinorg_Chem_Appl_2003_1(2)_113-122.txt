ABSTRACT
The affinity of melanin biopolymers for metal ions, drugs and other organic compounds is an important
factor in the etiology of toxic retinopathy, hiperpigmentation, otic lesions and irreversible extrapyramidal
disorders. The aim of the presented work was to examine the interaction of local anaesthetic drugs used in
ophthalmology with model DOPA-melanin in the presence of metal ions. It has been demonstrated that the
analyzed drugs form complexes with melanin biopolymer. Based on the .values of association constants,, the
following order of drugs affinity to melanin was found: tetracaine > procaine >> bupivacaine > lidocaine. It
has also been shown that Cu
)-+
and Zn
)-+
ions administered to DOPA-melanin before complexing with drugs
decrease the total amount of local anaesthetics bound to melanin. The blocking of some active centers in
melanin molecules by metal ions, which potentially exist in living systems, may change the clinical
therapeutic efficiency of the analyzed local anaesthetic drugs.
Key words: melanin, local anaesthetics, metal ion-melanin complexes, drug-melanin complexes

and melanin synthesis at cellular, subcellular, and enzymatic levels. The precursors of melanins are tyrosine,
DOPA and dopamine, which give eumelanin after oxidation, subsequent cyclization and polymerization.
Detailed molecular studies of melanin synthesis have shown that it is a very complex process involving
multiple enzymes/4/. Of all enzymes involved in the process, only tyrosinase is essential for the synthesis of
melanins/5/. The level and activities of melanogenic enzymes tyrosinase, TRP-1 and TRP-2 are regulated by
the MSH cell surface receptor and the melanosomal P-protein the two most obvious candidate genes
influencing variation in pigmentation phenotype/6,7/. Melanins occur in various tissues including skin, hair,
hair follicles, retinal pigment epithelium, choroid and iris of the eye, stria vascularis of the cochlea and
planum semilunatum of the ampullae of the ear and substantia nigra of the brain/8/. This pigment is found in
the nerve cells of the brain of larger animal species including man, in macrophages within the superficial
cervical lymph nodes/3/and as component ofhuman eosinophils/9/.
It is well known that a number of drugs and other chemicals are accumulated and retained for long
periods in pigmented tissues due to melanin affinity. The heterogeneity of substances with melanin affinity is
large: various drugs of different categories (psychotropic drugs, drugs for rheumatoid arthritis and malaria,
antineoplastic drugs, aminoglycoside antibiotics, local anaesthetics), herbicydes, dyes, alkaloids and metal
ions/10,11,12,13,14,15/. The accumulation of certain drugs in pigmented tissues, due to melanin affinity, is
possibly the most pronounced retention mechanism of the body. This accumulation is generally believed to
be the important factor in the etiology of toxic retinopathy, hyperpigmentation of the skin, hair bleaching,
irreversible extrapyramidal disorders, some ocular and inner ear lesions/8,16,17,18,19/.
It is also known that metal ions, which potentially exist in living systems, bind to melanin biopolymers
/20/and may affect the drug-melanin interaction. The melanin-metal ions binding has been ascribed to a
cation exchange activity of melanin, which in turn may be related to the presence of free carboxyl groups in
the melanin biopolymer. It was demonstrated that pigmented cells contain a rather high concentration of
metal ions as compared with non-melanized homologous tissues /21,22,23/. Furthermore, oxidative
transformations of melanin precursors (DOPA, dopamine, adrenaline) are catalyzed by Cu2+
and Cu2+-
containing enzymes /24/. It has been postulated that the affinity of melanins for metal ions can be an
important factor in the pathogenesis of some lesions, e.g. long-time exposure to manganese may cause
chronic extrapyramidal disorders due to metal accumulation on neuromelanin/25/.
Increasing use of intraocular local anaesthetics for ophthalmic surgery calls for a better understanding of
the mechanisms of various undesirable drugs effects. Long-term administration of local anaesthetics to the
eye has been associated with retarded healing and pitting and sloughing of the corneal epithelium and
predisposition ofthe eye to inadvertent injury/26,27,28/.
The aim of this study was to examine the interaction of local anaesthetic drugs used in ophthalmology
(lidocaine and bupivacaine) with model DOPA-melanin in the presence of metal ions (Cu2+
and Znz+
).
EXPERIMENTAL
Melanin synthesis
Model synthetic melanin was obtained by oxidative polymerization of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-
DOPA from Sigma) solution (lmg/ml) in 0.067 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) for 48h, according to the Binns
method/29/.

Metal ions-melanin complex formation
Dry DOPA-melanin samples of 300rag each were mixed with 300ml of bidistilled water containing
1.103M concentration of Cu2+
(CuCI2 2H_O, PPH POCH, Poland) or Znz+
(ZnCIz, Merck, Germany). The
mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 24h and then filtered. The amounts of copper and zinc
bound to melanin were determined by the use of atomic absorption spectrophotometer type AAS 3 (Carl
Zeiss, Jena). The final metal ions-DOPA-melanin complexes contained 0.43pmol Cu+/mg melanin and
0.30tmol Zn2+/mg melanin.
Drug-melanin complex formation
Binding of lidocaine (lidocaine hydrochloride, Polfa, Poland) and bupivacaine (bupivacaine
hydrochloride, Molteni Farmaceutici, Italy) to melanin was performed in 0.067M phosphate buffer at pH 7.0.
Drug-melanin complexes were obtained as follows: 5mg of melanin or metal ion-melanin complexes were
placed in plastic test-tubes, where drug solutions in phosphate buffer were added to a final volume of 5ml.
The initial concentration of drugs ranged from o104M to 1.103M. Control samples contained 5rag of
melanin and 5ml of buffer without drug. All samples were incubated for 24 h at room temperature, and then
filtered.
Analysis of drug binding to melanin
The concentrations of drugs remaining in each filtrate after incubation with melanin were determined
spectrophotometrically. All spectrophotometric measurements were made using the UV-VIS
spectrophotometer Jasco model V-530. The amounts of drug bound to melanin, calculated as the difference
between the initial amount of drug administered to melanin and the amount of unbound drug (in filtrate after
incubation) were expressed in lumoles of bound drug per mg melanin. The complex formation efficiency (in
%) was also determined as the ratio of drug (lumole) bound to melanin to the total amount of drug (pmole)
added to melanin, multiplied by 100. A qualitative analysis of drug-melanin interactions was performed using
the Scatchard plot of the experimental data according to Kalbitzer and Stehlik /30/. The number of binding
sites (n) and the values of association constant (K) were calculated.
RESULTS
The effect of metal ions on local anaesthetics-melanin complex formation efficiency is presented in Table
1. The affinity of lidocaine and bupivacaine to melanin and metal ion-melanin complexes was analyzed as
described in the Experimental section, whereas the results for procaine and tetracaine complexes are known
from previous studies/31/. As shown in Table 1, the two-fold increase of initial drug concentration (from
5.10aM to 1-103M) results in the decrease of percentage of drug bound to melanin or metal ion-melanin
complex. Simultaneously, the increase of the absolute amount of local anaesthetics bound to melanin (in

ability. The decrease of the amount of drug bound to melanin in the presence of metal ions was observed,
especially in the presence of Znz, as compared with drug-melanin complexes obtained in the absence of
metals.
The experimental data were also analyzed by constructing the Scatchard plots to determine the binding
sites and the number of relevant binding classes. For lidocaine-melanin and bupivacaine-melanin complexes
the Scatchard plots are linear (Fig. B), indicating that one class of binding sites participates in the formation
of these complexes. For procaine-melanin and tetracaine-melanin complexes the Scatchard plots were found
to be curvilinear/31/, which indicates that more than one binding class was involved. The calculated binding
parameters for the interaction of local anaesthetics with melanin and metal ion-melanin complexes are shown
in Table 2. The values of association constant for lidocaine-melanin and bupivacaine-melanin complexes
(K103M) demonstrate that mainly weakly reacting sites exist in these complexes. For procaine-melanin
and tetracaine-melanin interactions strong binding sites with the association constant KI05M and weak
binding sites with KzI03M

DISCUSSION
The eye is located externally i the body and is vulnerable to injury and exposure to toxic environmental
insults. Despite its small mass, it carries out biochemical processes which require an avid and diverse blood
supply. This results in this organ being second only to the liver in showing manifestations of drug toxicity
especially from compounds present in the systemic circulation/18/.
Optical measurements of the pigments of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid have shown
that choroidal melanin was always greater than that in the RPE. Simultaneously, it was found that the content
of both choroidal and RPE melanin showed a trend of decreasing with aging/32/. Prota et al. /33/ have stated
that in human irides both eumelanin and pheomelanin are present, which indicates that differences in stromal
pigmentation may be due not only to the quantity, but also to the nature of melanin pigment. It has also been
suggested that the differences between human brown and blue eyes in their melanin content may have
relevance to the pharmacokinetics of drugs that bind to melanin. This would mean that the larger amounts of
melanin would decrease the initial levels of the .drugs and would increase the drug levels after prolonged
periods/34/.
Although the biology of the pigment granules has been neglected in the past, they do seem to be involved
in many important functions, such as protection from oxidative stress, detoxification of peroxides, and
binding of metal ions and drugs, and, therefore, serve as a versatile partner of the retinal pigment epithelium
(RPE) cell. New findings show that the melanin granules are connected to the iysosomal degradation
pathway. Most of these functions are not yet understood, but it was demonstrated that the deficit of melanin
pigment is associated with age-related macula degeneration, the leading cause of blindness/35/.
At present, many drugs are known to be markedly accumulated and retained for a considerable time by
pigmented tissues and that the retention of these compounds is proportional to the degree of melanin
pigmentation/10/. The ability of melanins to bind different drugs and transition metal ions is probably of the
greatest biological importance/10,20,25,36/.
Many previous studies have focused on the ability of a compound to bind to melanin in vitro as a measure
of its affinity for melanin-containing structures in vivo. The experimental approach often entails the isolation
of melanin from biologic sources or the preparation of synthetic melanin from its precursors/37/. Synthetic
melanins prepared enzymatically or chemically from L-DOPA contain more carboxyl groups than natural
melanins /12/. Furthermore, one can assume that the ion-exchange, redox and fi'ee radical properties
established in synthetic melanin are also relevant for natural melanins /38/. Both natural and synthetic
melanin polymers have been used in binding studies of ligands and no significant differences in the affinity
were observed/12,39/. The earlier experiments with synthetic melanin have shown that metal ions had the
same order of affinity for synthetic melanin as for eye-melanin/20/. This suggests that the protein moiety of
the melanin plays a minor role in the binding of metal ions. However, a high affinity of metal ions for
melanin in vitro does not necessarily mean that a high uptake occurs also in vivo. Melanin is an intracellular
constituent, and transport barriers at the cell membranes may prevent ions fi'om reaching the melanin in vivo
/20/.
More complete analysis of the metal ions-melanin interaction was performed earlier in our laboratory
/36,40,41/. It was shown that two classes of independent binding sites participate in the interaction of Fe,

Or3+ Sn2+ Mn2+N1 Cu Cd and ions with DOPA-melanin, whereas for ions only one class of
binding sites was found. Sarna et al./221 and Froncisz et al./421 have shown that, depending on pH and the
metal ion concentration, metals form various complexes with melanin biopolymer that involve different
groups of the polymer and show different stabilities. Thus monodentate, bidentate and even tetradentate
complexes of Cu2+
ions with synthetic and natural melanin have been identified and a role of melanin
carboxyl, phenolic hydroxyl, amine and imine groups has been discussed. It has been also reported that
binding ofmetal ions to melanin is a time-dependent process/38,41/.
The effect of metal ions on drug binding ability to melanin was examined previously 140/. It has been
demonstrated that in the interaction of chloroquine with synthetic DOPA-melanin two classes of independent
binding sites must be implicated. Metal ions (Cu2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+) fixed by melanin polymer before
complexing with drug are the blocking agents, because only one class of binding sites has been found for
chloroquine-(metal ion-melanin) complexes 1431. It has also been shown that metal ions incorporated into
melanin during its synthesis modify the drug binding ability/44,451.
The results presented in this study indicate that local anaesthetics used in ophthalmology form complexes
with melanin biopolymer. Based on the values of association constants, the following order of drugs affinity
to synthetic DOPA-melanin was found: tetracaine > procaine >> bupivacaine >lidocaine. It has also been
demonstrated that Cu2+
and Zn2+
ions administered to DOPA-melanin before complexing with drugs decrease
the total amount of local anaesthetics bound to melanin. The nature of the melanin-ligand interactions is still
not well established but the existence of ionic bonds, Van der Waals forces, hydrophobic interactions and
change-transfer reactions in drug-melanin complex formation has been suggested/10/. Taking into account
that metal ions as well as the analyzed drugs exist in the form of cations at physiological pH, probably the
same active centers in melanin polyanion are responsible for these ligands binding. The blocking of some
active centers in melanin molecules by metal ions which potentially exist in living systems may change the
clinical therapeutic efficiency ofthe analyzed local anaesthetic drugs.
