INTRODUCTION
Sulpha drugs are a group of compounds used for
eliminating a wide range of infections in human and other animal
systems. Many chemotherapeutically important sulpha drugs, like
sulphadiazine, sulphathiazole, sulphamerazine, and so forth,
possess SO2NH moiety which is an important toxophoric function []. The heterocyclic compounds with both sulphur and nitrogen atoms in the ring system have also been used in the synthesis of biologically active complexes. It is however
noteworthy that the biological activity gets enhanced on
undergoing complexation with metal ions []. Schiff bases and their metal complexes have exhibited biological activity as
antibiotics, antiviral, and antitumor agents because of their
specific structures. Heteronuclear Schiff base complexes have been
found in applications as magnetic materials, catalysts and in the
biological engineering field [–].

Organosilicon compounds of sulphur-containing ligands have
attracted much attention recently due to their biological
importance. The sulphur containing ligands are well known for
their anticarcinogenic, antibacterial, tuberculostatic,
antifungal, insecticidal, and acaricidal activities. It has been
reported that the activity of sulphur-containing ligand increases
on complexation [–]. The interest in
organosilicon(IV) compounds is due to their versatile
applicability in the pharmaceutical industries. Generally,
organosilicon compounds seem to own their antitumour properties to the immuno defensive system of the organism [–].
The medical applications and effectiveness of the silatranes in
the treatment of wounds and tumours are thought to be related to
the role of silicon in the growth of epithelial and connective
tissues and hair, where its function is to impart strengths,
elasticity, and impermeability to water [].

The preparation and characterization of one biologically active
sulphonamide imine derived from 2-acetylfuran with sulphathiazole
and its silicon(IV) complexes form the subject of this paper. The
results of these investigations seem to be promising. Based on the
coordination sites available in the ligand system, this has been
classified as monobasic bidentate ligand ().

EXPERIMENT
Adequate care was taken to keep the organosilicon(IV) complexes,
chemicals, and glass apparatus free from moisture; clean and well-dried
glass apparatus fitted with quickfit interchangeable
standard ground joints was used throughout the experimental work.
All the chemicals and solvents used were dried and purified by
standard methods.

Physical measurements and analytical methods
Nitrogen and sulfur were estimated by the Kjeldhal's
and Messenger's methods, respectively. Silicon was determined
gravimetrically as SiO2. Molecular weights were
determined by the Rast camphor method (freezing point depression
method) using resublimed camphor (MP 178°C).

Conductance measurements
The conductance measurements were carried out in dry
dimethylformamide (DMF) at room temperature using a systronics
conductivity bridge (model 305) in conjunction with a cell
having a cell constant of 1.0.

Electronic spectra
The electronic spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer UV visible
spectrophotometer in the range 200–600 nm, using dry
methanol as the solvent.

IR spectra
Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Magna FT-IR 550
spectrophotometer in KBr pellets.

Nuclear magnetic resonance measurements
Multinuclear magnetic resonance spectra (1H,
13C, and 29Si) were recorded on an FX 90 Q
JEOL spectrometer operating at 90 MHz.

1H NMR spectra
1H NMR spectra were recorded in deuterated methanol at
89.55 MHz using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal
standard.

13C NMR spectra
13C NMR spectra were recorded in dry methanol using TMS
as the internal standard at 22.49 MHz.

29Si NMR spectra
29Si NMR spectra were recorded at 17.75 MHz using deuterated
dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO-d6) as the solvent.

Preparation of the ligand
The sulphonamide imine was prepared by the condensation of
2-acetylfuran with sulphathiazole in equimolar ratio in absolute
alcohol. The contents were refluxed for 3–4 hours and the
solid which separated out was filtered off, recrystallized from
the same solvent (ethanol), and dried in vacuo. The
physical properties and microanalysis of this sulphonamide imine
are recorded in .

Synthesis of the organosilicon(IV) complexes
For the synthesis of the complexes, first the sodium salt of the
ligand was prepared by dissolving sodium metal
(0.04–0.07 g) in 30 mL 
 of methanol. Now to the
weighed amount of organosilicon chlorides in 1 : 1
(0.38–0.51 g) or 1 : 2 molar ratios (0.11–0.29) in
20 mL methanol, the above prepared sodium salt of the ligand
was added. The solution was refluxed for a period of
15–17 hours. The white precipitate of sodium chloride, formed
during the course of the reaction, was removed by filtration and
the filtrate was dried under reduced pressure. The resulting
product was repeatedly washed with a mixture of methanol and
n-hexane (1 : 1 v/v) and then finally dried for
3–4 hours. The purity was further checked by TLC using silica
gel G. The details of these reactions and the analyses of the
resulting products are recorded in .

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The 1 : 1 and/or 1 : 2 molar reactions of Me2SiCl2,
Ph2SiCl2, and Ph3SiCl with sulphonamide imine
have led to the formation of Me2SiCl(2-Ac-F-St),
Me2Si(2-Ac-F-St)2, Ph2SiCl(2-Ac-F-St),
Ph2Si(2-Ac-F-St)2, and Ph3Si(2-Ac-F-St) types
of complexes. The reactions have been carried out in perfectly dry
methanolic medium and proceed smoothly with the precipitation of
NaCl. These reactions can be represented
by the general equations in
 showing the formations of the sodium salt
and the complexes.

The resulting coloured solids are soluble in most of the common
organic solvents. These have been found to be monomeric as
evidenced by their molecular weight determinations. The low values
of molar conductivity
(10–27 ohm−1 cm2 mol−1) of the resulting
silicon complexes in anhydrous DMF show them to be
nonelectrolytes in nature.

UV spectra
The electronic spectra of the sulphonamide imine and
its 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 organosilicon(IV) complexes have been
recorded. The spectrum of the ligand shows a broad band at
370 nm which can be assigned to the n-π*
transitions of the azomethine group. This band shows a blue shift
in the silicon complexes appearing at 351, 353, 359, and
355, 362 nm for 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 derivatives, respectively,
due to the polarisation within the &gt;C=N chromophore
caused due to formation of covalent silicon–nitrogen bond. The
bands at 255 and 285 nm are due to π–π*
transitions, within the benzene ring and (&gt;C=N) band
of the azomethine group, respectively. The K band
π–π* showed a red shift due to the overlap of the
central metal d-orbital with the p-orbital of the donor atom which
causes an increase in conjugation and the B-bands undergo a
hypsochromic shift in the complexes [], see
.

IR spectra
The assignments of characteristic IR frequencies for the resulting
complexes may be discussed as follows.

The IR spectra of these derivatives do not show any band in the
region 3400-3150 cm−1 which could be assigned to
νNH. This clearly indicates the deprotonation of the
ligand as a result of complexation with the silicon atom. A sharp
band at 1628 cm−1 due to ν(&gt;C=N)
frequency of the free azomethine group in the ligand shifts to the
lower frequency (ca 15 cm−1) in the silicon
complexes and indicating thereby the coordination of the
azomethine nitrogen to the silicon atom. A shift of this frequency
to the higher and lower wave number side as well as the “no change” has
also been reported in the literature [].

In dimethylsilicon(IV) complexes, a band at ca 1420 cm−1 has been ascribed to the asymmetric
deformation vibrations of (CH3−Si) group, whereas the
band at ca 1270 cm−1 has been ascribed to the symmetric
deformation mode of (CH3−Si) group. New bands are
observed in the spectra of the complexes at ca
570–582 cm−1 due to the ν(Si ← N)
vibrations. These remain absent in the spectrum of the ligand. A
band due to ν(Si−Cl) at ca 423 and
439 cm−1 is observed in 1 : 1 diorganosilicon(IV)
derivatives. It has been reported [] that the cis form of such complexes gives rise to two ν(Si ← N )
bands, whereas in the transform only one IR active ν(Si ← N) band is observed. The presence of only one
ν(Si ← N) band in the
present case suggests that the complexes exist in the transform, see .

1H NMR spectra
The proton magnetic resonance spectral data of sulphonamide imine
and its corresponding silicon complexes have been recorded in
DMSO-d6. The chemical shift values relative to the TMS peak
are listed in .

The broad signal due to the −NH proton in the ligand
disappears in the case of silicon complexes showing the
coordination of silicon to nitrogen after the deprotonation of
the functional group. The azomethine proton signal due to methyl
proton () appears at
δ 2.10 ppm in the ligand. The downfield shift of this
position in the spectra of the complexes substantiates the
coordination of azomethine nitrogen to the silicon atom. The
additional signal in the region δ (1.01 and 1.13 ppm) in Me2SiCl(2-Ac-F-St) and
Me2Si(2-Ac-F-St)2 types of complexes are due to
Me2Si group.

The ligand shows a complex pattern in the region δ 8.10–6.92 ppm for the aromatic protons and this is observed in the region δ 8.78–6.95 ppm in the spectra of the
organosilicon(IV) complexes. This shifting also supports the
coordination through the nitrogen atom.

13C NMR spectra
The conclusions drawn from the UV, IR, and 1H NMR spectra
are concurrent with the 13C NMR spectral data regarding
the confirmation of the proposed structure. 13C NMR spectra of the ligand and its silicon complexes were also
recorded in dry DMSO. The shifting of the signals due to carbon
attached to the azomethine nitrogen in the spectra of the complexes further supports the involvement of this group in
complexation []. Data are recorded in .

29Si NMR spectra
The 29Si NMR spectra of Me2SiCl(2-Ac-F-St),
Ph2SiCl(2-Ac-F-St), and Ph3Si(2-Ac-F-St) give
sharp signals at δ-91 to δ-98 ppm and the
spectra of Me2Si(2-Ac-F-St)2 and
Ph2Si(2-Ac-F-St)2 give sharp signals at δ-128
to δ-110 ppm, which clearly indicates the penta- and
hexa-coordinated environment, respectively, around the silicon atom.
Though, the exact geometries of these complexes can be suggested
on the basis of X-ray crystal structure; inspite of our best
efforts we could not develop a suitable crystal for the X-ray
studies. Hence, X-ray data could not be included in the present
paper.

Thus, on the basis of the above spectral features, as well as the
analytical data, the penta-coordinated trigonal bipyramidal and
hexa-coordinated octahedral geometries shown in
 have been suggested for the organosilicon(IV) complexes.

BIOLOGICAL ASPECTS
Fungicidal, bactericidal, nematicidal, and insecticidal activities
of the sulphonamide imine and its respective organosilicon(IV)
complexes against pathogenic fungi, bacteria, root-knot nematode,
and insect are recorded in Tables –.

Antifungal screening
Like plant cells, fungi also possess cell walls but they cannot
perform photosynthesis, moulds spoil food, damage potato, and crop
plants (corn and wheat). They also cause rotting of clothes,
shoes, and wooden materials. Some fungi cause diseases like
athlete's foot and ring worm.

Method
The antifungal activities were evaluated against
Macrophomina phaseolina, Aspergillus niger,
Fusarium oxysporum, and Alternaria alternata by agar
plate technique []. The compounds were dissolved in
25, 50, and 100 ppm concentrations in methanol and then
mixed with the medium. The linear growth of the fungus was
obtained by measuring the diameter of the colony after 96 hours.
The inhibition percentage was calculated as 
100 (Dfc − Dft)/Dfc, where Dfc and Dft are the diameters of the fungus colony in the control and the test plates, respectively.

Antibacterial screening
Of all the microorganisms, bacteria are the most abundant. They
generally reproduce quite fast, such as P cepacicola which
reproduces itself every 9.5 minutes. However, some bacteria are
very slow growing, such as those that cause tuberculosis and
leprosy. This makes early diagnosis of these diseases rather
difficult. The most common bacteria used for scientific research
is E coli. Its normal living place is the lower human
intestine (COLON).

Method
Bactericidal activities were evaluated by the paper disc plate
method []. The nutrient agar medium (peptone, beef extract,
NaCl, and agar-agar) and 5 mm diameter paper discs
(Whatman No. 1) were used. The compounds were dissolved in
methanol in 500 and 1000 ppm concentrations. The filter
paper discs were soaked in different solutions of the compounds,
dried, and then placed in the petri plates previously seeded with
the test organisms (P cepacicola, E coli, K aerogenous,
and S aureus). The plates were incubated for
24–30 hours at 28±2°C and the inhibition zone around
each disc was measured.

Observations
The free ligand and its respective metal chelates were screened
against selected fungi and bacteria to assess their potential as
antimicrobial agents. The results are quite promising. The
antimicrobial data reveal that the complexes are superior than the
free ligands. The enhanced activity of the silicon chelates may be
ascribed to the increased lipophilic nature of
these complexes arising due to the chelation []. The
toxicity increased as the concentration was increased. Further,
the results of bioactivity were compared with the conventional
fungicide, Bavistin, and the conventional bactericide,
Streptomycin, taken as standards in either case.

In fungicide activity, most of the organosilicon(IV) complexes
were able to inhibit and kill the pathogens at 50 ppm
concentration, whilst 100 ppm concentration proved
invariably fatal. None of the fungi was able to withstand this
concentration. In bactericidal activity, the complexes exhibited
remarkable potential in inhibiting the growth of pathogens. Many
of the complexes were found to be even more toxic than the
standard. Thus, it can be postulated that further intensive
studies of these complexes in this direction as well as in
agriculture could lead to the interesting results.

Nematicidal activity
Development of the concept of pest management and their
implementation have led to a greater appreciation of the need for
a wide range of tactics for nematode control. The objective of
nematode control is to improve growth and yield of plants, which
can be achieved through a reduction of the nematode population in
soil or in plants, or through a reduction of their damage.
Chemical method can be used to control nematodes [].
M incognita produce galls on the roots of many
host plants and responsible for 44.87 percent of yield loss in
brinjal [].

Method
First of all we applied different concentrations (25, 50, and
100) in ppm of complexes and ligand on root-knot nematode
M incognita spp. in a step-by-step []
procedure. For experiment, egg masses were separated from heavily
infected brinjal roots and washed under running water. After
cutting the roots, one percent of sodium hypochlorite
solution was added, shaked, and then sieved through 150 and
400 sieves. Then the eggs of nematode were counted and
replicated three times. At this experiment, temperature range was
30 ± 2°C.

Observations
Maximum hatching was recorded in control. All the metal complexes
are more toxic than the ligand and all bimolar complexes are more
active than unimolar organosilicon derivatives.
Dimethylsilicon(IV) complexes are less hazardous than
diphenylsilicon(IV) complexes. The activity increases with
increasing the concentration of the solutions.

Mode of action []
Much smaller amounts of the nonfumigant and fumigant    
nematicides are needed in plant protection
against nematode because the indirect hematostatic effects of
non-fumigant nematicides resulting from impairment of
neuromuscular activity, interfere with movement, feeding,
invasion, development, reproduction, fecundity, and hatching of
nematodes which are considered more important than their
direct killing action.

Insecticidal activity
Many insects cause injury to economic plants by feeding on them
externally: by chewing their leaves or other part: In order to
raise more food, man has devised methods to alter normal
population growth of many insect pests by reducing their chance
for survival. To control the insect pests, the man since long has
been employing various strategies which include mechanical,
physical, chemical, and biological methods [].

Methods
Ovicidal
To determine the efficacy of complexes as ovicide,
eggs were treated by contact method. By spreading 1 mL of
complex solutions on petri dishes (5.0 cm diameter), a thin
film of 100 and 200 concentrations were prepared.
The solvent was allowed to evaporate 200 eggs for
0–24 hours and kept in contact with the insecticidal film
through out their incubation period. A control with each
experiment was also run in which the eggs were kept in 1 mL of
solvent. By Abott's formula [], percentage of egg of mortality
and percentage of corrected egg of mortality were
calculated. 


where KT = % kill in treated, KC = % kill in control.

Larvicidal
By feeding method larvicidal efficacy of the synthesized chemicals was assessed.
The last instar larvae were separated from subculture
and kept in vials containing 5 g of topically treated wheat
grains with 1 mL of chemicals. Until the pupal formation,
larvae were allowed to continue their development on this diet, replicated thrice, each dose.
The food was treated with solvent only in control. By Abott's
formula, larval of mortality and percentage of corrected
of mortality were calculated.

Pupicidal
From the subculture, the last larval instars were
stored out and were kept in separate container. Pupal of known age
(0–12 hours) were taken out and were dipped in the
desired concentration (100 and 200) of the chemicals along
with a control of three replicates that were
set for each dose and total emergence and pupal of mortality were
recorded after 96 hours. By Abott's formula, percentage
of pupal of mortality and percentage of pupal
corrected of mortality were calculated.

Adulticidal
By contact method the adulticidal action was
assessed. With 1 mL of respective doses, 5 g  of wheat
grains were treated. The solvent was allowed to evaporate
completely. Along with a control, experiment was replicated
thrice. Newly emerged adults were taken from the subculture and
were released in the plastic vials containing treated food. After
48-hour observations were taken and by Abott's formula, percentage of
corrected of mortality was calculated.

Mode of action []
Some insecticides are physical poisons causing asphyxiation, some
are protoplasmic poisons, a few are respiratory poisons, but the
majority of them are nerve poisons. The action of insecticides
upsets the normal behaviour and actions of the target organisms.

Ovicidal, larvicidal, pupicidal, and adulticidal results are shown
in Tables , , , and . The data indicated the same observations as were
observed in nematicidal activity.
