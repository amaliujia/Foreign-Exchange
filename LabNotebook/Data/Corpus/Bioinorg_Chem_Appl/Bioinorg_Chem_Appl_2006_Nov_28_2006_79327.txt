INTRODUCTION
77Se NMR spectroscopy is one
of powerful tools to study selenium compounds
[–],
containing bioactive materials [–].
77Se NMR chemical shifts (δ(Se)) are
sharply sensitive to the structural changes in selenium compounds.
Therefore, they are widely applied to determine the structures
[–] and to follow
up the reactions of selenium compounds
[–]. The δ(Se)
values have been analyzed variously. The substituent effect is
employed when the effect of the electronic conditions around
Se on δ(Se) is examined in
p-YC6H4SeR perturbed by Y, for example
[–]. Some
empirical rules and/or classifications between structures and
δ(Se) are proposed
[–], however, it
is not so easy to predict δ(Se) from the structures
with substantial accuracy. Some important rules would be behind
the observed values. Plain rules, founded on the theoretical
background, are necessary to analyze the structures of selenium
compounds based on δ(Se) and also to understand the
origin of δ(Se) [].

We have pointed out the importance of the
orientational effect on δ(Se) of
p-YC6H4SeR, for the better
 understanding of δ(Se) of ArSeR in a uniform
 manner [, , ]. To establish the orientational
effect, we present two series of δ(Se) for
p-YC6H4SeR whose structures (conformers) are fixed to
planar (pl) and perpendicular (pd)
conformers for all Y examined, under the conditions [, ].
(The nonplanar and nonperpendicular conformer (np) is
also important in some cases, such as the CC conformer
in 1,8-(MeZ)2C10H6 (Z = S and Se)
[–].) (The importance of relative
conformations in the substituent effects between substituents and
probe sites is pointed out.) The Se−CR bond in
ArSeR is on the Ar plane in pl and
perpendicular to the plane in pd.
9-(Arylselanyl)anthracenes (p-YC6H4SeAtc: 1)
and 1-(arylselanyl)anthraquinones (p-YC6H4SeAtq:
2) are the candidates for pl and
pd, respectively: Y in 1 and 2
are H (a), NMe2 (b),
OMe (c), Me (d), F
(e), Cl (f), Br
(g), COOEt (h), CN
(i), and NO2 (j) (see
). Conformers of the 9-anthracenyl (9-Atc)
and 1-anthraquinonyl (1-Atq) groups in 1 and
2 are represented by the type A
(A), type B (B), and type
C (C) notation, which is proposed for
1-(arylselanyl)naphthalenes (p-YC6H4SeNap:
3) [–, , , ]. The structure of
1 is A for 9-Atc and pl for
Ar, which is denoted by 1 (A:
pl). That of 2 is B for the 1-Atq
and pd for Ar (2 (B:
pd)). The series of δ(Se) in 1
(δ(Se: 1)) and δ(Se:
2) must be typical for pl and pd,
respectively.

Recently, the reliability of the calculated absolute magnetic
shielding tensors (σ) is much improved
[–] and the calculated tensors for Se nuclei (σ(Se)) are demonstrated to be useful in usual selenium compounds [–]. As shown in , the total absolute magnetic shielding tensor (σt) is decomposed into diamagnetic (σd) and paramagnetic 
(σp) contributions
[, ].  σp contributes
predominantly to σt in the structural change of
selenium compounds. Magnetic shielding tensors consist of three
components, as exemplified by σp in  as the following:

Quantum chemical (QC) calculations are performed on ArSeH (4), ArSeMe (5), and ArSePh (6) to
understand the orientational effect based on the theoretical
background (see ). The conformations are
fixed to pl and pd in the calculations. The
gauge-independent atomic orbital (GIAO) method
[–] is applied to evaluate
σ(Se) at the DFT (B3LYP) level. Mechanisms of the
orientational effect are explored for pl and
pd based on the magnetic perturbation theory on the
molecules.

After the establishment of the orientational effect of aryl group
in p-YC6H4SeR, together with the mechanism,
δ(Se) of some aryl selenides are plotted versus
δ(Se: 1) and/or δ(Se:
2). The treatment shows how δ(Se) of aryl selenides are interpreted based on the
orientational effect. And it is demonstrated that the sets of
δ(Se: 1) and δ(Se:
2) give a reliable guideline to analyze the structures
of p-YC6H4SeR based on δ(Se).

RESULTS
The structures of all members of 1 and 2 are
predicted to be 1 (A: pl) and
2 (B: pd), respectively [].
The results are supported by the X-ray crystallographic analysis
carried out for 1 and 2, containing
1c and 2a and the QC calculations for
1a and 2a, together with the spectroscopic
measurements, although not shown.  illustrates

2a) are given from MeSeMe and

4). The a values for 1 are smaller than those for
2. The results show that the temperature dependence in
1 is larger than that of 2, although both
correlations are excellent (r &gt; 0.999). The results show that
2 (B: pd) are thermally very
stable and other conformers are substantially negligible in the
solution for all Y examined. 1 (A:
pl) must also be predominant in solutions, although
1 (A: pl) would not be thermally
so stable, relative to the case of 2 (B:
pd).

 shows the axes and some orbitals of
4–6, together with
SeH2. While the x-axis of SeH2 is in the
bisected direction of ∠HSeH, the Se−H and
Se−C bonds of MeSeH are almost on the x- and
y-axes, respectively, although not shown. Axes of
4–6 are close to those in MeSeH in
most cases. Since ∠CSeX (X = H or C)
in 4–6 are about 95°, 98°,
and 101°, respectively, the Se−C and Se−H
bonds deviate inevitably from the axes to some extent. Axes are
rather similar to those of SeH2 for 4
(pl) with Y = Br and COOMe and
5 (pl) with Y = Me and
CN.

Structures of 4–6 in pl and
pd are optimized employing the 6-311+G(3df) basis sets
for Se and the 6-311+G(3d,2p) basis sets for other nuclei
of the Gaussian 03 program []. Calculations are performed at the density
functional theory (DFT) level of the Becke three parameter hybrid
functionals with the Lee-Yang-Parr correlation functional (B3LYP).
Absolute magnetic shielding tensors of Se
(σ(Se)) are calculated based on the DFT-GIAO method
[–], applying on the optimized structures

6 [, ] (see ). The values
are plotted versus δ(Se: 1)SCS
and/or δ(Se: 2)SCS to explain the
δ(Se) based on the orientational effect of the aryl
groups.

DISCUSSION
Characters in δ(Se: 1) and
δ(Se: 2)
The structures of all members of 1 and
2 are confirmed to be 1 (A:
pl) and (B: pd), respectively,
(see ) []. The nature of
δ(Se: 1) must be the results of
1 (A: pl), where np(Se)
is parallel to the π(C6H4Y-p). Characteristic
points in δ(Se: 1)SCS are
summarized as follows.

Large upfield shifts (−23 ppm to −6 ppm) are
observed for Y = NMe2, OMe, and Me and large
downfield shifts (17 ppm to 33 ppm) are for Y =
COOEt, CN, and NO2, relative to Y =
H.

Moderate upfield shift (−3 ppm) is observed for
Y = F.

Small downfield shifts (2 ppm) are for Y =
Cl and Br: the three points corresponding to
Y = H, Cl, and Br are found very
close with each other.

The characters of δ(Se: 2)SCS are
very different from those of δ(Se:
1)SCS. The characteristics must be the reflection
of 2 (B: pd), where
np(Se) is perpendicular to π(C6H4Y-p).
Characteristic points of δ(Se:
2)SCS are as follows.

Large upfield shifts (−21 to −6 ppm) are observed for
Y = NMe2, OMe, Me, F, Cl, and
Br, relative to Y = H.

Downfield shifts (3 ppm to 9 ppm) are brought
by Y = CN and NO2, where the magnitude by Y =
CN is larger than that by NO2.

δ(Se: 2)SCS brought by Y =
COOEt is negligible.

While δ(Se: 1)SCS is in a range of
−23 &lt; δ(Se)SCS &lt; 33 ppm, δ(Se:
2)SCS is −21 &lt; δ(Se)SCS &lt;
9 ppm. Y of both donors and acceptors operate well on
δ(Se: 1)SCS , whereas only Y of donors do well on δ(Se: 2)SCS.

δ(Se: 2)SCS are
plotted versus those of δ(Se:
1)SCS.  shows the results.
Indeed, it emphasizes the difference in the characters between
δ(Se: 1)SCS and δ(Se:
2)SCS, but most of δ(Se:
2)SCS seem to correlate well with
δ(Se: 1)SCS, as shown by a dotted
line (a = 0.58). Two points corresponding to Y = H and
NO2 deviate upside and downside from the line,
respectively. Namely, points for 2 with Y of
non-H are more downside (upfield) than expected from
δ(Se: 1a)SCS and
δ(Se: 2a)SCS, especially for
δ(Se: 2j)SCS.

Why are such peculiar behaviors observed in 1 and
2, caused by the orientational effect of the aryl
group? The mechanism is elucidated based on the QC calculations
performed on 4–6, assuming pl
and pd for each.

Observed δ(Se) versus calculated
σt(Se)
The δ(Se)SCS values of 1 and
2 are plotted versus
σtrel(Se)SCS of 4 (pl)–6 (pl) and 4
(pd)–6 (pd), respectively,
(). Good correlations are obtained as shown in
 (entries 5–10). The r values become larger in an order of 4(pl) &lt; 5(pl) ≦ 6(pl) for 1 and
in an order of 5(pd) &lt; 4(pd) ≈ 6(pd) for
2. Namely, observed δ(Se:
1)SCS and δ(Se:
2)SCS are reproduced by
σtrel(Se: 6
(pl))SCS and σtrel(Se:
6 (pd))SCS, respectively, in most
successfully.  exhibits the plots for (a)
1 versus 6 (pl) and (b)
2 versus 6 (pd). The correlations
are given in  (entries 7 and 10). The results
demonstrate that the characters of δ(Se)SCS
observed in 1 originate from the planar structure and
those in 2 from the characteristic structure, where
Se−CAtq in p-YC6H4SeAtq is perpendicular to
the p-YC6H4 plane.

How does such orientational effect arise from the structures? How
does the electronic property of Y affect on δ(Se) of
1 and 2? σp(Se) of
4–6 are analyzed next.

Orientational effect in 4a–6a
σ(Se) of 4–6 shown in Tables – are examined. σp(Se) and
σt(Se) of 4a (pd) are
evaluated to be larger (more upfield) than those of 4a
(pl) by 43 ppm and 46 ppm,
respectively, which correspond to the
orientational effect caused by
Ph in 4a. The
inverse orientational effect is predicted for 5a.
σp(Se) and σt(Se) of
5a (pd) are smaller than those of
5a (pl) by 41 ppm and
49 ppm, respectively. While σp(Se) and
σt(Se) of 5a (pl) are smaller
than those of 4a (pl) by 90 ppm and
83 ppm, respectively, the values of 5a
(pd) are smaller than those of 4a
(pd) by 174 ppm and 178 ppm, respectively. The
differences are −84 ppm and −95 ppm, respectively,
which also correspond to the differences in the orientational
effect of the Ph group between 5a and 4a,
respectively. The more effective contribution to downfield shifts
by the Se−CMe bond in 5a (pd),
relative to 5a (pl), must be responsible for
the results. The orientational effect cannot be discussed
for 6a of the Cs symmetry with Y = H.

What mechanism is operating in the Y dependence?
σp(Se) of 4–6 in
pl and pd are analyzed next.

Y dependence in 4–6
To get an image in the behavior of σp(Se)xx,
σp(Se)yy, and σp(Se)zz of
4–6, the values are plotted versus
σp(Se).  shows the plots for
4 (pd) and 6 (pl). The
correlations in 4 (pd) are linear and both
σp(Se)xx and σp(Se)yy
increase along with σp(Se). The plot for
5 (pd) is similar to that for 4
(pd), although not shown. In the case of 6
(pl), the correlations are linear but the slope for
σp(Se)yy is inverse to that for
σp(Se)xx. The plots of
σp(Se)xx and σp(Se)yy do
not give smooth lines for 4 (pl),
5 (pl), and 6 (pd).
However, the slopes for σp(Se)zz are very
smooth and the magnitudes are very close to 1.0 for all cases in
4–6.

To clarify the behavior of σp(Se) in
4–6, σp(Se) are plotted
versus (σp(Se)xx +
σp(Se)yy). Excellent to good
correlations are obtained in all cases as collected in

 (entries 11–16).
 exhibits the plot of σp(Se)
for 6 (pd), for example. The correlation
constants (a) are 0.31–0.37, which are very close to one
third. The results exhibit that (σp(Se)xx+σp(Se)yy) determines
σp(Se) of 4–6 effectively
(cf: ). The observations led us to establish the
mechanism of Y dependence in 4–6.

Mechanism of Y dependence
The mechanism of Y dependence in 4–6 is
elucidated by exemplifying 4. As shown in
, the main interaction between Se and Y
in 4 (pl) is the
4pz(Se)-π(C6H4)-pz(Y) type, which
modifies the contributions of 4pz(Se) in
π(SeC6H4Y) and π*(SeC6H4Y). Since
(σp(Se)xx + σp(Se)yy) controls
σp(Se) of 4 (pl) effectively,
admixtures between 4pz(Se) in modified
π(SeC6H4Y) and π*(SeC6H4Y) with
4py(Se) and 4px(Se) in
σ(CArSeH) and σ*(CArSeH)
must originate the Y dependence mainly when a magnetic field is
applied. Since
σpzz,N contains the ^Lz,N operator, σpzz,N arises from admixtures between atomic px and py orbitals of N in various molecular orbitals. When a
magnetic field is applied on a selenium compound, mixings of
unoccupied molecular orbitals (MO's; ψi) into occupied
orbital MO's (ψi) will occur. Such admixtures generate
σpzz,N if ψi and ψj contain px and py of N,
for example. σpxx,N and σpyy,N are also
understood similarly. Consequently, Y of both donors and acceptors
are effective for the Y dependence in 4
(pl).  shows the mechanism for
pl.

In the case of 4 (pd), 4pz(Se)
remains in np(Se) in the almost pure form. The
σ(CArSeH)-π(C6H4)-px(Y)
interaction occurs instead, which modifies the contributions of
4px(Se) and 4py(Se) in σ(CArSeH) and
σ*(CArSeH) (see ).
(σp(Se)xx + σp(Se)yy) determines
effectively σp(Se) of 4 (pd).
Therefore, Y dependence of 4 (pd) originates
mainly from admixtures between 4pz(Se) in
np(Se) and 4px(Se) and 4py(Se) in
modified σ*(CArSeH) since np(Se) of
4pz(Se) is filled with electrons. Consequently, Y
dependence in 4 (pd) must be more sensitive
to Y of donors, which is a striking contrast to the case of
4 (pl).  summarizes the
mechanism for pd.

The mechanisms proposed for 4 (pl) and
4 (pd) must be
applicable to 5 and 6. The expectations are
just observed in δ(Se: 1)SCS and δ(Se: 2)SCS.

Applications of δ(Se: 1) and
δ(Se: 2) as the standards
Odom made a lot of effort to explain δ(Se) of
7 based on the electronic effect of Y [].
However, the attempt was not successful: δ(Se:
7) were not correlated well with δ(Se:
5). How are δ(Se) of
p-YC6H4SeR interpreted based on the
orientational effect? Our explanation for the relationship
between δ(Se) of p-YC6H4SeR and the
structures is as follows.

 shows the plot of δ(Se:
5)SCS measured in CDCl3 [] versus
δ(Se: 1)SCS, 213 K and the
correlation is given in  (entry 17: r =
0.997). The correlation coefficient is excellent when
δ(Se: 5)SCS measured in neat is
plotted versus δ(Se: 1)SCS, 213
K (entry 18 in : r = 0.999). These
observations must be the results of the Se−CMe bond in
5 being on the p-YC6H4 plane in solutions
for all Y examined, under the conditions. On the other hand,
δ(Se: 7)SCS do not correlate with
δ(Se: 1)SCS, 213 K. Instead,
they correlate well with δ(Se:
2)SCS, 213 K (entry 19 in
: r = 0.995).  shows the
plot. The results are rationally explained by assuming that the
Se−CO bond in 7 is perpendicular to the
p-YC6H4 plane in solutions for all Y examined, under
the conditions.

δ(Se)SCS of 6 [] and
8 [] are similarly plotted versus
δ(Se: 1)SCS, 213 K. They give
good correlations, although the r values
become poorer relative to that for 5 (entries
20 and 21 in ). The reason would be the
equilibrium of pl with pd for some Y in
6 and 8, may be Y of donors.

δ(Se)SCS of 9 are also plotted
versus δ(Se: 1)SCS, 213 K. The correlations are excellent (entry 22 in : r =
0.999). It is worthwhile to comment that the energy lowering
effect by Se4 4c–6e in 9 fixes the
conformation 9 (pl, pl) for both
p-YC6H4Se groups in solutions for all Y
examined, under the conditions [].

It is demonstrated that sets of δ(Se: 1)
and δ(Se: 2) proposed in this work can be
the standards for pl and pd,
respectively, when δ(Se) of aryl selenides
are analyzed based on the orientational effect.

CONCLUSION
The orientational effect is empirically established by the Y
dependence on δ(Se: 1) and
δ(Se: 2). The Y dependence
observed in 1 and 2 is demonstrated
by σt(Se) calculated for 4–6
with the DFT-GIAO method. While σt(Se) of
4a (pl) is predicted to be more
negative than that of 4a (pd)
by 46 ppm, σt(Se) of 5a
(pl) is evaluated to be larger than that of
5a (pd) by 49 ppm, which
corresponds to the orientational effect by the Ph group in 4a and 5a,
respectively. Excellent to good correlations are obtained in the
plots of σp(Se) versus (σp(Se)xx+σp(Se)yy) for 4–6 in
pl and pd. It is demonstrated that
(σp(Se)xx + σp(Se)yy)
effectively controls σp(Se) of
4–6 in pl and
pd.

The mechanisms of the Y dependence are proposed based
on the magnetic perturbation theory. The main interaction
in pl is the
np(Se)-π(C6H4)-pz(Y) conjugation. Y
dependence in pl occurs through admixtures of
4pz(Se) in modified π(SeC6H4Y) and
π*(SeC6H4Y) with 4px(Se) and
4py(Se) in σ(CSeX) and
σ*(CSeX) (X = H or C). The main
interaction in pd is the
σ(CSeX)-π(C6H4)-px(Y) type, which
modifies both σ(CArSeH) and
σ*(CArSeH). The Y dependence in pd
mainly originates from admixtures of 4pz(Se) in
np(Se) with 4px(Se) and 4py(Se) in
modified σ*(CSeX) since np(Se) of
4pz(Se) is filled with electrons. Therefore, Y of both
donors and acceptors are effective in pl, whereas Y of
donors are more effective in pd. The expectations are
just observed in 1 and 2. Sets of
δ(Se: 1) and δ(Se:
2) can be used as the standards for pl and
pd, respectively, when δ(Se) of aryl
selenides are analyzed.

The effect of R in ArSeR is also important, which is
in progress. The results will be discussed elsewhere, together
with the applications of the method.

EXPERIMENTAL
NMR spectra were recorded at 25°C on a JEOL JNM-AL 300
spectrometer (1H, 300 MHz; 13C, 75.45 MHz; 77Se, 57.25 MHz). The
1H, 13C, and 77Se chemical
shifts are given in parts per million relative to those of
Me4Si, internal CDCl3 in the solvent, and external
MeSeMe, respectively.

Preparation of compounds
1a–1j were prepared by the reactions of
anthracenylgrignard reagents with arylselanylbromides and/or
aromatic diazonium salts with anthracenylselenolates as the case
of 3 []. 2a–2j were
prepared by the reactions of 8-chloroanthraquione and
arylselenolates with CuI as described earlier [].
Elementary analyses for the compounds were satisfactory to those
calculated within ±0.3% accuracy. 1H,
13C, and 77Se NMR chemical shifts of the
compounds rationalize the structures.

MO calculations
Quantum chemical (QC) calculations were performed using a
Silent-SCC T2 (Itanium2) computer with the 6-311+G(3df) basis sets
for Se and 6-311+G(3d,2p) for other nuclei of the Gaussian
03 program []. Calculations are performed on
4–6 in pl and pd at
the density functional theory (DFT) level of the Becke three
parameter hybrid functionals combined with the
Lee-Yang-Parr correlation functional (B3LYP). Absolute magnetic shielding
tensors of Se nuclei (σ(Se)) are calculated
based on the gauge-independent atomic orbital (GIAO) method,
applying on the optimized structures with the same method.

Structures of 1a–3a in various conformers
are also optimized, containing frequency analysis, with the
B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) method.

1 The contribution of relativistic terms has been pointed out for heavier atoms, but the
perturbation would be small for the selenium nucleus.

2 This decomposition includes small arbitrariness due to the coordinate origin dependence, though it
does not damage our chemical analyses and insights into the 77Se NMR spectroscopy.

3 The 0.050 M CDCl3 solutions
were used for NMR measurements. However, the concentrations would
be lower for the compounds of low solubility, such as
1j and 2j, especially at 213 K.

[] are not the same as those shown in , axes are interchanged so as to be those in 
for convenience of discussion, if possible.

6 The torsional angle of φ = CoCiSeH in
4 (pd) is fixed at 90.0° if
4 (pd) is not the Cs symmetry (eg,
Y = COOMe and OMe). Similarly, those of
φ = CoCiSeCMe and φ = CiSeCMeH in 5 (pd) are
fixed at 90.0° and 180°, respectively, and those of
φ = CoCiSeCi' and φ = CiSeCi'Co' in 6
(pd) are fixed at 90.0° and 0°,
respectively, when the conformers are not the Cs symmetry.

7 The DFT shieldings are deshielded in general, due to the underestimation of the orbital
energy differences, which lead to the overestimation of the
σp(Se) []. MP2 calculations are also
performed on 4a (pl), 4a
(pd), 5a (pl), and 5a
(pd). The geometries are optimized with the
MP2/6-311+G(3d,2p) method. σt(Se) are calculated
with the MP2-GIAO method, employing the 6-311+G(2d,p) basis sets.
The results are as follows (in ppm): (σt(Se:
4a (pl)),
σt(Se: 4a
(pd))) = (1827.3, 1865.5) and
(σt(Se: 5a
(pl)), σt(Se:
5a (pd))) = (1761.0,
1708.7). σt(Se: 4a (pl)) is
evaluated to be more downfield than σt(Se:
4a (pd)) by 38 ppm, whereas
σt(Se: 5a (pl)) is evaluated
to be more upfield than σt(Se: 5a
(pd)) by 52 ppm. The results support the
orientational effects evaluated at the DFT level for 4a
and 5a, although the basis sets are not the same.

8 σp(Se)zz
is almost constant in the change of Y for both pl and
pd in 4–6. The small
Y-dependence of σp(Se)zz is reasonably
explained through the main interaction of the
4pz(Se)-π(C6H4)-pz(Y) type in
pl, where 4px(Se) and 4py(Se) do
not take part in the interaction directly. The main interaction in
pd is the
σ(CArSeX)-π(C6H4)-px(Y) (X =
H or C) type, which modifies the
contributions of 4px(Se) and 4py(Se) in the
CArSeX bonds. However, the results show that the
interaction in pd affects on
σp(Se)xx and σp(Se)yy but
not on σp(Se)zz.

9 σp is exactly expressed by Ramsey's
equation []. While σp is evaluated accurately by
the CPHF method, it is approximated as σpzz,N = −(μoe2/2m2e) Σiocc Σjunocc
(ɛj − ɛi)−1 × {&lt; ψi|^Lz|ψj &gt;&lt; ψj|^Lz,N

10 The interactions between np(Se) of 4pz(Se) and
phenyl σ orbitals in 4a (pd) must be
weak due to large energy differences between 4pz(Se) and the σ orbitals. Long distances between them are also
disadvantageous.
