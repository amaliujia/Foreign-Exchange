ABSTRACT
Batch and column experiments were performed to determine the Cu(II) binding capacity of silica-
immobilized humin biomass. For column studies, 500 bed volumes of a 0.1mM Cu(II) solution were passed
through humin packed columns at the flow rates of 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 mL/min. The biopolymer showed an
average Cu binding capacity of 12 + 1.5 mg/g and a Cu recovery of about 96.5 % + 1.5. The breakthrough
points for Cu(II) alone were approximately 420, 390, 385, and 300 bed volumes for the flow rates of 1, 1.5, 2
and 3 mL/min, respectively. The interference studies demonstrated that at low concentrations, the hard
cations Ca(II) and Mg(II) did not seem to represent a major interference on Cu(II) binding to the humin
biopolymer. The selectivity showed by this biopolymer was Cu(II)>Ca(II)>Mg(II). On the other hand, batch
experiments showed that Ca(II) + Mg(II) at 100mM each reduced the Cu(II) binding to 73 %. However,
1000 mM concentrations of Ca(II) and Mg(II), separately and in mixture, reduced the Cu(II) binding to 47 %,
44 % and 31%, respectively. The results of this study showed that immobilized humin in a silica matrix
could represent an inexpensive bio-source for Cu removal from contaminated water, even in the presence of
low concentrations of the hard cations Ca(II) and Mg(II).

300,000 g/mol/2/. Humin represents the humic fraction of the natural organic matter that cannot be extracted
with organic solvents or diluted in basic or acidic solutions. Due to its high molecular weight and carbon
content, humin can partly elude biodegradation and fossilize after deposition in hydromorphous
environments/1/. Furthermore, humin is often the main form of organic matter in many types of soils/1/. It
has been reported that humic substances can interact with metals via chelation, physical adsorption and cation
exchange processes. However, the structure of these substances remains largely unknown/1,3/.
Heavy metals are common contaminants derived from industrial activities and considerable efforts have
been made in order to remove these contaminants from soils and aqueous solutions/4,5/. However, scientists
and engineers are still searching for more economical solutions to alleviate these problems. Although the use
of biomass as heavy metal sorbent has been documented in the literature/4,6-13,17-19/, further investigation
needs to be performed in order to understand the binding mechanisms of heavy metals to organic molecules.
As an example, it has been found that peat moss contains polar functional groups such as ketones, aldehydes,
acids and phenols that might be involved in the chemical binding of heavy metals/12/. Batch and column
experiments have been performed with peat moss, activated carbon, plant biomass, and chitin to elucidate
both the heavy metal binding ability of the biomass and the binding mechanisms/6-10/. Similarly, several
researchers have reported on Cu binding to humic fractions/5-7,9/; however, there is not enough information
about the performance of these biomasses under flow conditions.
Although it has been demonstrated that different biomasses bind heavy metals, usually the biomass
cannot be packed alone into a column because the small particles might clog the pores restricting the solution
flow. However, if the biomass is immobilized in a polymer matrix, bigger particles can be obtained and
packed into a column through which a flow rate can be achieved. In addition, the immobilized biomass offers
the possibility to be used several times. The objective of this research was to evaluate the efficiency of native
and immobilized humin biomass to remove Cu(II) ions from aqueous solutions under flow conditions.
Additionally, experiments were performed to evaluate the recycling capacity of the column as well as their
efficiency to adsorb Cu(II) in the presence of the interference cations Ca(II) and Mg(II).
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Extraction of humin
The procedure used in the present investigation to extract humin was previously described by Gardea-
Torresdey et al. /13/. A fraction of 100 g of Canadian Sphagnum peat moss (Fisons Horticulture, Inc.,
Vancouver, B.C., Canada) was dried at 5 IC for 72 h. The dried biomass was ground to a fine powder and
sieved through an 80-mesh screen (0.177 mm). Afterwards, the powder was washed twice with 0.01M HCI
and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 3000 rpm (Fisher Scientific, Marathon 6 K). Subsequently, 500 mL of 0.1M
NaOH were added to the biomass and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 13.5 by the addition of 5M
NaOH. The solution was stirred for 48 h and then centrifuged at 3000 rpm. The humin fraction precipitated
and the humic acids remained in the supernatant. The humin fraction was washed twice with deionized (DI)
water to eliminate the remaining alkalinity. Afterwards, it was freeze-dried on a Labconco freeze-dryer
..forge L. Gardea-Torresdey Bioinorganic Chemisoy andApplications
system (Freezone 4.5, Kansas City, MO) at -45C and 69 X 10-3
Mbar pressure. The dried biomass was again
ground and sieved through a 100-mesh screen (aprox.150 tm size particle).
2.2 Immobilization of humin biomass
The procedure followed for humin immobilization.was similar to the one reported by Gardea-Torresdey
et al./8/. Twenty g of humin previously sieved through a 100-mesh screen (0.149 mm) were washed twice
with 0.01M HCI and once with DI water. The washings were collected, evaporated and weighed to record
any loss of biomass. Three hundred mL of 5 % H2SO4 were placed in a 2-L beaker and a solution of 6 %
Na2SiO3 was added until a pH of 2 was reached. Under continuous stirring, the washed biomass was added to
the H2SO4/NazSiO3 solution and allowed to equilibrate for approximately 15 min. Additional sodium silicate
solution was added until a pH of 7 was reached and the polymer started forming. The polymer gel was
washed with DI water until washings were negative for sulfate presence by using the BaC12 test (formation of
BaSO4 precipitate). The polymer was dried overnight in an oven at 60C; then, the polymer was ground using
a mortar and pestle and sieved to pass the 20-40-mesh size (approximately 0.841-0.354 mm).
2.3 Column study for Cu(ll) adsorption by silica-immobilized humin
Column experiments were performed at pH 5 0.1, since de la Rosa et al. /6/reported that this is the
optimal pH for Cu(II) binding to humin. The columns were packed using 3 mL of silica-immobilized humin
(this volume of biomass was considered as one bed volume). After packing, the columns were washed with
0.01M HCI to discard any possible metal contamination. Subsequently, the columns were washed with DI
water previously adjusted to pH 5 +/- 0.1 until the washings were shown to have the same pH value. To
determine the optimal flow rate for Cu binding to the silica-immobilized humin, 500 bed volumes of a
0.1 mM Cu(II) solution were passed through different columns using the following flow rates: 1, 1.5, 2, and 3
mL/min. The effluents of each column were collected and the metal content was determined with a Flame
Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (FAAS) (Perkin Elmer model 3110). Three cycles were run on each
column to determine the capacity of the polymer after the corresponding saturation and stripping cycle. In
order to recover the metal ions adsorbed to the column, 30 bed volumes of 0.1M HC1 were passed and the
corresponding effluents were collected and analyzed by FAAS to quantify Cu ions and the percent of
recovery. After each cycle, the columns were washed with DI water previously adjusted to pH 5 on inverted
flow, in order to destroy any preference channels that might have been formed. The washing was stopped
when the column reached the pH of 5 + 0.1.
2.4 Batch experiments for the interference of Ca(ll) and Mg(ll) on Cu(ll) binding to humin.
Table 1 shows the concentration of the solutions used in this study. The concentrations of Ca(II) and
Mg(ll) solutions varied from 0 mM to 1000 mM, while Cu(II) was kept at 0.1mM. The following
compounds: Ca(NO3)2.4HzO, Mg(NO3)_. 6HzO, and Cu(NO3)2 were used as cation sources. A portion of 500

mg of biomass was washed 3 times with 0.01M HC1 and 3 times with double deionized water (DDI) to
reduce any external source of Ca(II) and Mg(II). The biomass was resuspended in 100 mL of DDI water to
obtain a final concentration of 5 mg/mL, which was adjusted to pH 5 + 0.1 using either HNO3 or NaOH.
Subsequently, aliquots of 4 mL were transferred to 5 mL test tubes, centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min and
the supernatants were discarded. Afterwards, 4 mL of the Cu(II) solution adjusted to pH 5 + 0.1 were added
to the reaction tubes, placed on a rocker and allowed to react for 1 h. Finally, the tubes were centrifuged for 5
min at 3000 rpm, and the cations Ca, Mg, and Cu were analyzed in the supernatant using Inductively
Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP/OES). Each treatment was replicated three times for
statistical purposes.

Table 2 shows the metal mixtures and the concentrations of the solutions used for this experiment. The
concentration of Cu(II) was maintained at 0.1 mM, while the solutions containing either Ca(II), Mg(II) or
both were kept at a concentration of 1 mM. Three columns were packed as described in section 2.3, and 500
bed volumes of the corresponding solution were passed through each column. The flow rate used was 2
mL/min, and all the solutions were prepared using DDI water.

DV with an AS-90 plus auto sampler rack. The following parameters were utilized: nebulizer flow 0.7 L/min,
radio frequency power 1300 watts; sample introduction 1.45 mL/min; flush time 10 sec; delay time 60 sec;
read time 10 sec; wash time 45 sec; replicates 3, and each sample was read three times. Standards were
prepared from a 1000-ppm Cu(II) stock solution and diluted with 5% HNO3. The stock solutions of Ca(II)
and Mg(II) had a concentration of 2M diluted with 5% HNO3. The blank and six points were used to obtain
the calibration curve, and the correlation coefficients (r2) were 0.999 or better.
2.6.2 Metal analysisfor column experiments
As previously described, the copper analysis in column experiments was performed using FAAS. Six
standards were used to obtain a calibration curve with a minimum correlation coefficient (r2) of 0.99.
Standards were prepared from a 1000-ppm Cu standard solution and diluted with 0.01M HC1. The readings
were performed at 327.4 nm and an impact bead was used to improve the instrument sensitivity/14/. Samples
were analyzed up to 500 bed volumes and the difference between the metal concentration in the control
solution and the metal concentration found in the effluent was assumed to be the Cu bound to the column.
2.7 Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM)
The scanning electron microscopy technique was used to obtain information about the surface of the
biomass with the polysilicate matrix support. The results obtained herein provided information about the
interactions between the biomass and the metals before and after saturation and stripping. An environmental
scanning electron microscope (ESEM) model 2020 was used to record micrographs of the particles and to
analyze the surface composition of the polymer.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
3.1 Effect of flow rate on Cu(ll) adsorption by a silica-immobilized humin column.
Column experiments were performed at pH 5 + 0.1, since previous batch experiments demonstrated that
humin extracted from Canadian Sphagnum peat moss showed its best Cu(II) binding capacity at this pH /6/.
Table 3 shows the effect of four different flow rates on Cu(II) desorption from the humin biopolymer. This
table shows that the percentage of Cu recovery was pretty much the same in the three cycles, regardless of
the flow rate used. Similarly, the amounts of Cu bound to the biomass at the different flow rates showed little
differences among them (Table 4). Table 3 also shows that the percentage of Cu recovery from the biomass
under flow conditions had an average of 98 % for the 1 and 1.5 mL/min flow rates, but 97 and 94 % for the
flow rates 2 and 3 mL/min, respectively. On the other hand, the column showed an average binding capacity
of 11.9 + 0.3 mg Cu/g of biomass (Table 4). The Cu binding capacity shown by silica-immobilized humin is
larger that the binding capacity reported by other researchers. Kappor et al. /17/reported that Aspergillus
niger binds 2.09 mg Cu/g of biomass; Blanco et al. /18/found that Phormidium Laminosum immobilized-
biomass removed 10 mg/g Cu, while Johnson et al. /20/reported that the maximum Cu binding capacity of

The breakthrough curves for Cu(II) at different flow rates are shown in Figures 1 to 4. Figure 1 shows
that at the flow rate of mL/min, Cu appears in the effluent after 420, 415, and 405 bed volumes in the first,
second and third saturation cycles, respectively. Thus, in the third cycle the column showed a decrease in its
Cu binding capacity of about 4%, which indicates the potential reusability of the column. Figure 2 shows the
breakthrough curves for the 1.5 mL/min flow rate. As shown in this figure, in the first cycle Cu(lI) appears in
the effluent after 380 bed volumes (without saturation of the column). The Cu(II) concentration in the
effluent at that point was only 0.6 mg/L, this means 5.44 mg/L less than the Cu concentration in the influent
that was 6 mg/L. In this cycle, even at 450 bed volumes no saturation of the column was observed. In the
second cycle the breakthrough point was detected after 360 bed volumes, and up to 500 bed volumes the
Cu(ll) concentration was around half the concentration of this metal in the fed solution. Finally, on the third
cycle the breakthrough point appeared 50 bed volumes before as compared to the one observed in the second
cycle. Figure 3 shows the breakthroughs obtained using the 2 mL/min flow rate. The breakthrough point for

the first cycle appeared at almost 400 bed volumes, decreasing 50 bed volumes in the second cycle. However,
the breakthrough point was almost the same in the second and third cycles. It was also found that up to 500
bed volumes the column did not reach the saturation point in the three cycles, since the concentration of Cu
in the influent was 4.8 mg/L but in the effluent was 3.1 mg/L. Similar results were found by de la Rosa et al.
/19/in experiments performed with the same biomass at this flow rate. Figure 4 displays the breakthrough
curves for the 3-mL/min-flow rate. This figure shows that in the first and second cycle Cu appeared in the
effluent solution after 280 bed volumes, but even after 500 bed volumes the column was not saturated. The
Cu(II) concentration in the effluent were 2.4 and 3.4 ppm for the first and second cycle, respectively. These
concentrations were, respectively, 3.6 and 2.4 less than the concentration in the fed solution that was 6 mg/L.
In the third cycle the breakthrough point appeared at 230 bed volumes. Although Cu appeared earlier as
compared to the first and second cycles, after 500 bed volumes the column was not saturated, since at this
point the concentration of Cu(II) in the effluent was 4.4 mg/L. Based on these observations, it is possible to
assume that the humin-immobilized biomass can be used for additional cycles.
It has been proposed that carboxyl groups may represent an important role in Cu binding/16/; thus, by
lowering the pH, it is possible to protonate the copper-carboxylate moieties and the metal ions may be put
back into the solution. Based on this, Cu was desorbed after each saturation cycle by using 24 bed volumes of
0.1 M HCI. The results are given in Table 3. According to the data, Cu was recovered in a high percentage in
each of the three cycles after stripping. The best flow rates seem to be and 1.5 mL/min where late
breakthrough points and the highest percentage of recovery were observed. However, the results obtained at

the flow rate of 2 mL/min were similar to those obtained at 1.5 mL/min. The preferential flow rate order for
Cu binding to the immobilized-humin was lmL/min>l.5mL/min_>2mL/min>3mL/min. In general, it was
observed that the percentage of Cu recovered was pretty much the same in the three cycles, independently of
the flow rate and the Cu binding as well. These percentages of recovery indicated that HCI is a good stripping
agent for Cu. Furthermore, after three cycles, no changes in the Cu binding capacity to humin-silica matrix
were observed.
3.2 Batch experiments for Ca(ll) and Mg(II) interference on Cu(II) binding to silica-
immobilized humin
The individual and combined effect of Ca(II) and Mg(II) on Cu(II) binding to silica-immobilized humin
are shown in Figure 5. As it can be seen in the figure, Ca(II) and Mg(II) at concentrations of 2.0 mM and
below did not interfere in the Cu binding to the humin biopolymer. Figure 5 also shows that Ca(II) interfered
more than Mg(II). At the concentration of 200 mM, Ca(II) caused higher interference (66 %) than when
Mg(II) was also present (69 %). Finally, at 1000 mM, the Cu(II) binding was 47% when Ca(II) was present,
44 % on the presence of Mg(II), and when both cations were present, the Cu binding dropped to 31%. This
might indicate that it is the quantity of the hard cations present in solution instead of their nature that
contributes to the interference of Cu(II) binding to silica-immobilized humin. In previous studies, other

researchers found similar results using different biomasses /8,11/. These researchers concluded that the
binding of different heavy metals to the functional groups present in the biomass may occur through an ion
exchange reaction. Thus, the quantity of ions in solution is an important factor, instead of the competition for
binding sites. Furthermore, Martell and Smith /15/ have proposed that some functional groups, such as
carboxylates, have larger stability constants for heavy metals than for hard ions.
3.3 Column experiments for Ca(ll) and Mg(ll) interference on Cu binding to the humin
biopolymer.
Column experiments were performed in order to determine the interference of Ca(II) and Mg(II) on
Cu(II) binding to the silica-immobilized biopolymer under flow conditions. These experiments were carried
out using individual and combined solutions of lmM Ca(II) and Mg(II), a Cu(II) concentration of 0.1 mM,
and a flow rate of 2mL/min. These parameters were chosen based on the data obtained in the batch
experiments previously discussed. In addition, at the 2 mL/min flow rate, the binding capacity and Cu
recovery was as good as at 1 mL/min flow rate, and time can be saved using the faster feasible velocity.
The breakthrough curves for the mixtures Cu-Ca, Cu-Mg, and Cu-Ca-Mg are shown in Figure 6. As one
can see in this figure, in the presence of Mg(II), Cu appeared in the effluent after 250 bed volumes. However,
when Ca(II) was present in the solutions, Cu appeared before 50 bed volumes, which indicates that Mg(II)
slightly affected the Cu(ll) binding to the humin biopolymer. Also, in the presence of Ca, after 500 bed

volumes the column was not saturated, since at that point the Cu concentration in the effluent was 5.5 mg/L.
This observation indicated that most of the interference for Cu(II) binding was due to Ca(II). The results
indicate that the presence of hard cations at high concentrations interfere in the Cu binding to silica-
immobilized humin. However, it is important to consider that the concentrations of Ca(II) and Mg(II) used in
the column experiments were ten times higher than the concentration of Cu(II). Comparing Figure 6 and
Figures 11-4, it can be seen that high concentrations of Ca(II) and Mg(II) strongly affected the Cu(II) binding
capacity of the humin biopolymer.
3.4 Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM)
A scanning electron microphotograph of a small bead of silica-humin matrix after saturation with Cu is
shown in Figure 7a. In this figure, bright dots can be observed. The mapping of the bead surface showed that
the dots correspond to the signal for Cu (data not shown). These dots are between 923 nm to 2.16 m in
diameter. Figure 7b displays the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) graph corresponding to Figure
7a. This figure clearly shows the peaks corresponding to Cu sorbed into the silica-polymer matrix (Si and Cu
K emission signals arc observed).

4. CONCLUSIONS
The results of this research showed that silica-immobilized humin is a promising alternative for Cu
removal under various flow conditions. In the absence of hard cations, the breakthrough points for Cu(II)
binding in a solution of pH 5 + 0.1 were approximately 420, 390, 385, and 300 bed volumes at flow rates of
I, 1.5, 2 and 3 mL/min, respectively. Thecopper binding capacity of humin biopolymer was around 12 + 1.5

mg/g and the percentages of Cu recovery had an average of 96.5% + 1.5. At lower concentrations, e.g. less
than 2.0 mM, Ca(II) and Mg(II) did not interfere with Cu(II) binding to the humin biopolymer. This suggests
that silica-immobilized humin could be used as an inexpensive bio-sorbent for Cu removal from
contaminated water.
