INTRODUCTION
Intracellular trafficking of most soluble lysosomal proteins depends on their interaction with
M6P (mannose 6-phosphate) receptors []. Two M6P receptors are
known to occur in mammalian cells, the 300 kDa M6P/IGF2R [IGF (insulin-like growth factor) II
receptor] and MPR46 (46 kDa M6P receptor). Studies on MPR46- and/or M6P/IGF2R-negative cells
have indicated that the simultaneous presence of both receptors is necessary for the optimal
delivery of lysosomal enzymes to these compartments [,]. However, M6P/IGF2R is generally more efficient than
MPR46 in mediating lysosomal enzyme transport, which is at least partly owing to the capacity
of M6P/IGF2R to retrieve secreted M6P-modified proteins via the endocytic route [].

M6P/IGF2R is a multifunctional membrane-associated protein with a repetitive structure consisting
of 15 contiguous repeating segments []. Its two M6P-binding
sites are located in domains 3 and 9. An additional binding site for
M6P-N-acetylglucosamine residues is located in domain 5 of the protein []. Aside of lysosomal enzymes, M6P/IGF2R is supposed to bind also
other glycoproteins, such as latent TGF-β (transforming growth factor β) in an
M6P-dependent manner. It has been suggested that binding to M6P/IGF2R is required for the
pericellular activation of TGF-β []. However, the
physiological significance of the interaction of M6P/IGF2R with non-lysosomal M6P-modified proteins
is still largely unclear.

In addition to interactions mediated by its carbohydrate-binding sites, M6P/IGF2R also has the
capacity to bind various proteins by other modes of action, including IGF-II. The principal binding
site for IGF-II resides in domain 11 of the receptor [,]. It has been shown that mice with a targeted disruption of the
M6P/IGF2R locus die perinatally, which can be rescued by simultaneous ablation of the
IGF-II gene []. This indicates that
M6P/IGF2R plays a pivotal role in the control of the biological activities of IGF-II. Substantial
evidence has been provided that M6P/IGF2R promotes endocytosis and subsequent degradation of IGF-II
in lysosomes, thus restricting its bioavailability. Hence M6P/IGF2R counteracts excessive IGF-II
signalling through type 1 IGF and insulin receptors rather than directly participating in a
signal transduction cascade []. It has, however, been
proposed that M6P/IGF2R is also capable of acting as a signalling receptor under certain
circumstances [,].

Given the physiological significance of M6P/IGF2R in the control of important signal transduction
events, it is of note that the gene encoding the receptor is frequently mutated in human and animal
tumours [,].
Evidence has been provided that loss-of-function mutations in M6P/IGF2R contribute to cancer
progression, lending support to the notion that this receptor might be a tumour suppressor.
Tumour-associated M6P/IGF2R alterations were mainly located in domains 9, 10 and 11 of the receptor
[–], with
this region of the protein hosting one of the two M6P-binding sites and the major site of
interaction with IGF-II []. The tumour-suppressive potential
of M6P/IGF2R is supposed to rely largely on its dampening impact on IGF-II signalling. It has also
been suggested that M6P/IGF2R restricts tumour progression by modulation of latent TGF-β
activation at the cell surface []. However, M6P/IGF2R binds
a variety of other factors that could exert an influence on the proliferation, migration and/or
invasiveness of tumour cells, including heparanase and cysteine cathepsins [–].

Although the growth-suppressive role of M6P/IGF2R is well documented, its impact on tumour
invasion and metastasis remains poorly understood. It has been put forward that loss of M6P/IGF2R
may promote the invasiveness of malignant tumour cells [].
Various studies have shown that M6P/IGF2R indeed has the capacity to impede tumour cell migration
[,].
Interestingly, we have recently found that M6P/IGF2R modulates the invasiveness of liver cells via
its capacity to bind M6P-modified proteins []. However, the
exact mechanisms underlying the anti-invasive properties of M6P/IGF2R in SCC (squamous cell
carcinoma) cells remain to be elucidated. Furthermore, it is still unknown whether the individual
M6P-binding sites of the receptor serve complementary or redundant functions in the context of
anchorage-independent growth and matrix invasion by cancer cells.

We have previously reported that reconstitution of M6P/IGF2R expression in receptor-deficient
SCC-VII cells improves the intracellular accumulation of lysosomal enzymes, restores the formation
of dense lysosomes and reduces the invasive propensity of the cells []. This cellular system was now used to assess the relevance of the different
ligand-binding sites of M6P/IGF2R for the biological activities of the receptor by introducing point
mutations known to selectively interfere with binding of individual ligands [,].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Antibodies
Rabbit antisera raised against bovine M6P/IGF2R, mouse CD (cathepsin D) and mouse proCL
(cathepsin L) were kindly provided by Professor Bernard Hoflack (Technical University of Dresden,
Dresden, Germany), Professor Regina Pohlmann (University of Münster, Münster, Germany)
and Professor Ann H. Erickson (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, U.S.A.) respectively.
Monoclonal antibodies against rat GM130 (cis-Golgi matrix protein of
130 kDa; BD Biosciences) and PDI (protein disulfide isomerase; Stressgen Bioreagents) were
obtained from the indicated commercial suppliers.

Generation of SCC-VII cells expressing human M6P/IGF2R variants
The generation of mutant M6P/IGF2R cDNAs and their insertion into the expression vector pAHygCMV2
has been described previously []. The plasmid
pAHygCMV2/IGF2R encoding wt (wild-type) human M6P/IGF2R was as described previously []. M6P/IGF2R-deficient parental SCC-VII cells [] were transfected with wt or mutant pAHygCMV2/IGF2R constructs
using Lipofectin® (Invitrogen) and then subjected to selection with hygromycin B
(Invitrogen). The clones thus obtained were tested for M6P/IGF2R expression as outlined previously
for the isolation of SCC-VII/IGF2R wt-1 and wt-2 cells expressing the wt receptor [,]. The isolation of
mock-transfected SCC-VII cells has been reported previously [,].

Preparation of total cellular membranes
Confluent cell monolayers (1×107 cells) were harvested in 500 μl
of PBS containing proteinase inhibitors {1 mM PMSF, 5 μg/ml E-64
[trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane] and
5 μg/ml leupeptin} and disrupted by ultrasonication. Post-nuclear supernatants were
obtained by low-speed centrifugation (5 min at 320 g,
followed by 5 min at 800 g) and then centrifuged for
60 min at 35000 rev./min (Beckman Coulter 50 Ti rotor) to sediment the
membranes.

Phosphomannan-binding assays
Total cellular membranes were resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer
[0.15 M NaCl, 50 mM imidazole/HCl (pH 7.0) and 0.02% NaN3]
containing proteinase inhibitors and extracted with 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 for 30 min at
0°C. Aliquots of these membrane extracts corresponding to 150 μg of total
protein were diluted 10-fold with binding buffer and incubated with 40 μl of settled
phosphomannan–Sepharose beads [] on an end-over-end
mixer for 16 h at 4°C. The beads were then washed five times with 1 ml of
binding buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. After another wash with 40 μl of
5 mM glucose 6-phosphate (Sigma–Aldrich), the specifically bound material was eluted
with 40 μl of 5 mM M6P (Sigma–Aldrich) in the binding buffer.

IGF-II-binding assays
Total cellular membrane extracts (100 μg of total protein) were diluted 10-fold
with binding buffer [0.4 M KCl, 50 mM imidazole/HCl (pH 7.0) and 0.02%
NaN3 containing 0.1% Triton X-100]. The samples were then incubated either with
1 μg of biotinylated IGF-II (Gropep) or BSA for 16 h at 4°C on an
end-over-end mixer, prior to capture of the biotinylated proteins with 40 μl of
avidin–Sepharose beads for another 16 h at 4°C []. The beads were then washed five times with 1 ml of binding buffer and twice with
1 ml of 10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 6.8). Finally, bound proteins were eluted with
SDS/PAGE sample buffer [125 mM Tris/HCl (pH 6.8), 10 mM dithioerythritol, 1%
(w/v) SDS, 10% (w/v) glycerol and 0.01% Bromophenol Blue] by incubation for 5 min at
65°C.

Immunoblotting analysis
Western blotting analysis of M6P/IGF2R was performed after separation by SDS/PAGE (7.5% gel)
under reducing conditions. SDS/PAGE (14% gel) was used for the analysis of the other proteins.
Samples were denatured for 5 min at 65°C (M6P/IGF2R) or 95°C (other proteins)
prior to electrophoresis and blotting on to Hybond-C nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare). Bound
primary antibodies were detected with goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins conjugated
to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and chemiluminescence reagents []. Densitometric analysis of immunoblots was done using
ImageQuaNT v4.2 software (Molecular Dynamics).

Subcellular fractionation
Post-nuclear supernatants were obtained and fractionated by density-gradient centrifugation in
18% (v/v) Percoll (GE Healthcare) gradients (initial density of 1.055 g/ml) as described
previously []. The gradients were divided into ten
fractions which were then analysed for their activity of the lysosomal marker enzyme HEX
(β-N-acetylhexosaminidase). For immunoblot detection of other lysosomal
proteins (CD and CL) as well as GM130 (Golgi) and PDI (endoplasmic reticulum), fractions 1–3
(heavy fraction), 4–7 (intermediate fraction) and 8–10 (light fraction) were pooled
and extracted as described previously [,].

Proliferation assays
Cells (6×105) were resuspended in 10 ml of culture medium and seeded
into 58-cm2 dishes. After incubation for 24–72 h, the cultures were
harvested by trypsinization and their cell number determined using a Fuchs–Rosenthal
chamber.

Soft agar colony-formation assays
Cells (3×103) were added to 4 ml of medium containing 0.3% agar and
seeded into 21-cm2 dishes. Colonies obtained after culture for 3 weeks were then counted
and their areas determined as described previously [].

Matrigel invasion assays
Cells (5×104) were resuspended in 200 μl of serum-free medium
containing 0.1% BSA and then seeded on top of Matrigel-coated filters placed in wells filled with
700 μl of conditioned fibroblast medium [].
After incubation for 24 h at 37°C, the cells were fixed with methanol and then stained
with Crystal Violet. After removal of the cells remaining on the upper side of the filter with a
cotton swab, the filters were analysed as described previously [].

Other methods
Lysosomal enzyme secretion studies and fluorescence microscopy were performed as described
previously [,,]. Total protein content was determined either
with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) or the BCA (bicinchoninic acid) Protein
Assay Kit (Pierce) as appropriate, using BSA as a standard. Statistical analyses were performed
using Student's t test, with P&lt;0.05 being considered
significant.

RESULTS
Characterization of mutant M6P/IGF2R variants stably expressed in SCC-VII cells
M6P/IGF2R contains three carbohydrate-binding sites within its extracytoplasmic region, with two
of them displaying high affinities for M6P []. Studies on
bovine M6P/IGF2R have demonstrated an important role for conserved arginine residues in domain 3
(Arg435) and domain 9 (Arg1334) in M6P binding. Replacement of
Arg435 and Arg1334 (pre-protein numbering) with alanine or charge-conservative
lysine residues resulted in complete loss of M6P-binding activity []. A structure-based sequence alignment identified Arg426 (domain 3) and
Arg1325 (domain 9) as the corresponding residues in the human receptor []. We therefore prepared a Lys426/Lys1325
double-mutant human M6P/IGF2R construct (M6P/IGF2R Dom3/9mut) as well as the respective
single-mutant receptor cDNAs, each of the latter still harbouring one functional M6P-binding site.
Furthermore, a cDNA variant encoding a point mutation in domain 11 (Ile1572→Thr)
was generated (M6P/IGF2R Dom11mut). This mutation has been previously shown to abrogate
binding of IGF-II [,].

The mutant M6P/IGF2R cDNAs were then stably expressed in M6P/IGF2R-deficient SCC-VII cells. For
each mutant, at least two representative transfectants were chosen for further experiments. The
expression levels of the different M6P/IGF2R constructs in the selected cell lines were estimated by
immunoblotting (Supplementary Table S1 at http://www.biochemj.org/bj/451/bj4510091add.htm). The receptor content of all selected
lines (1.0–2.2 pmol/mg) was well within the physiological range [] and comparable with that of SCC-VII cells expressing wt M6P/IGF2R
(1.0–4.1 pmol/mg) [].

The subcellular distribution of the mutant M6P/IGF2R variants was investigated by means of
fluorescence microscopy. We have previously shown that wt M6P/IGF2R ectopically expressed in SCC-VII
cells is present in the perinuclear compartments reminiscent of the Golgi apparatus and
Golgi-associated structures such as the trans-Golgi network []. Immunocytochemical detection of all mutant receptor forms revealed a similar
subcellular distribution. This could be verified by complete colocalization with the Golgi marker
GM130 (Supplementary Figure S1 at http://www.biochemj.org/bj/451/bj4510091add.htm).

To investigate whether the mutant M6P/IGF2R forms stably expressed in SCC-VII cells fold and
function properly, M6P- and IGF-II-binding studies with membrane extracts of the respective cell
lines were performed. The M6P/IGF2R Dom3mut and Dom9mut constructs containing
single Arg→Lys point mutations were found to bind IGF-II and phosphomannan, an M6P-containing
polysaccharide, like the wt receptor. As anticipated, the double mutant M6P/IGF2R
Dom3/9mut did not interact with phosphomannan, but retained its ability to bind IGF-II.
Conversely M6P/IGF2R Dom11mut was found to be incapable of interacting with IGF-II,
whereas its binding to phosphomannan was not compromized ().

Ligand-binding properties of mutant forms of M6P/IGF2R
Left-hand panel, membrane extracts of SCC-VII cells expressing either wt or mutant M6P/IGF2R were
incubated with either biotinylated IGF-II or BSA prior to the addition of avidin–Sepharose
beads. The bound material was then subjected to immunoblotting analysis with anti-M6P/IGF2R
antibodies. Right-hand panel, membrane extracts of SCC-VII cells expressing either wt or mutant
receptor variants were incubated with phosphomannan–Sepharose beads. After washing with
glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), the specifically bound proteins were eluted with M6P prior to analysis by
immunoblotting with anti-M6P/IGF2R antibodies. T, total material applied to the beads. *A

Lysosomal enzyme transport in SCC-VII cells expressing mutant M6P/IGF2R variants
In order to assess whether the M6P/IGF2R mutants are functional in lysosomal enzyme trafficking,
the intra- and extra-cellular activities of the lysosomal marker HEX were determined. It should be
noted that this assay does not discriminate between direct lysosomal sorting of HEX and
reinternalization of secreted enzyme. In our previous study [], we have already reported that expression of the wt M6P/IGF2R in SCC-VII cells results
in a markedly reduced HEX content of the medium (11–24% of the total activity) as compared
with parental and mock-transfected cells (59–62%). A similar observation was now made for
M6P/IGF2R Dom11mut-producing cells (16–21% extracellular HEX), indicating that
M6P/IGF2R Dom11mut is fully competent in delivering lysosomal enzymes to their
intracellular destination ().

Secretion of lysosomal enzymes by parental and transfected SCC-VII cells
Cells were cultured for 24 h prior to assaying the cell extracts and conditioned medium
for their HEX, CD and CL contents. Results are means±S.E.M. for 3–17 independent
experiments. n.a., not analysed.

†HEX data taken from [].

Interestingly, extracellular accumulation of HEX by SCC-VII cells expressing M6P/IGF2R
Dom3mut (23–31%) or Dom9mut (20–24%) is at best moderately
increased. Expression of M6P/IGF2R Dom3/9mut led to more HEX being present in the medium
(33–43%). However, this value is still significantly lower than that determined for
mock-transfected or parental SCC-VII cells (). To
assess whether the improved retention of HEX by SCC-VII cells expressing mutant M6P/IGF2R is indeed
related to the ectopic presence of the receptor, the cells were treated with NH4Cl, a
lysosomotropic amine known to interfere with intracellular sorting of lysosomal enzymes. As
previously reported for the wt receptor [],
NH4Cl treatment of cells expressing M6P/IGF2R mutants increased the fraction of
extracellular HEX to 45–64% (Supplementary Table S2 at http://www.biochemj.org/bj/451/bj4510091add.htm).

We also analysed the intracellular retention of two other lysosomal enzymes, CD and CL, by
SCC-VII cells expressing M6P/IGF2R variants with impaired M6P-binding sites. Upon expression of wt
M6P/IGF2R, the fraction of CD accumulating in the medium was reduced from 53–67% to
12–15%. The extracellular CD fraction was also lower in SCC-VII cells expressing either
M6P/IGF2R mutant with only one functional M6P-binding site (16–43%). In contrast, SCC-VII
cells expressing M6P/IGF2R Dom3/9mut accumulated only slightly less CD (48–52%) in
the medium than parental and mock-transfected SCC-VII cells ().

The effect of wt M6P/IGF2R expression on CL retention by SCC-VII cells is much weaker than for
HEX and CD [], which could be related to the existence of
an alternative targeting pathway for this enzyme [].
M6P/IGF2R Dom3mut transfectants were found to deliver even slightly less CL into their
medium (68–74%) than cells expressing the wt receptor (73–81%), whereas M6P/IGF2R
Dom9mut (84%) and Dom3/9mut cells (77–87%) release almost the same
proportion of their CL as their parental and mock-transfected counterparts (85–87%; ).

Despite its presence at the cell surface and its recycling between the plasma membrane and
intracellular compartments, MPR46 fails to mediate internalization of exogenous ligands. In
contrast, M6P/IGF2R is capable of internalizing lysosomal enzymes from secretions []. It has been shown that the addition of M6P to the culture
medium completely inhibits the reuptake of secreted lysosomal enzymes, without affecting
biosynthetic sorting []. In the case of SCC-VII cells
expressing wt M6P/IGF2R, cultivation in the presence of 5 mM M6P increased the extracellular
HEX fraction by 22% of the total enzyme activity. A similar effect was observed for M6P/IGF2R
Dom3mut (21–24%) and Dom9mut cells (20–22%). In contrast, the
effect of M6P on extracellular HEX accumulation in cultures of M6P/IGF2R
Dom3/9mut-expressing cells was far less pronounced (5%), as also observed for parental
and mock-transfected cells (≤2%). These results demonstrate that the presence of either
M6P-binding site is sufficient for normal receptor function in the secretion–recapture
pathway ().

Lysosomal enzyme delivery via the secretion-recapture pathway in SCC-VII cells expressing
mutant M6P/IGF2R
SCC-VII cells expressing either wt or mutant M6P/IGF2R were cultured for 24 h in the
presence or absence of 5 mM M6P. Parental and mock-transfected SCC-VII cells were analysed in
parallel. Cell homogenates and conditioned medium were then analysed for their HEX activity. Results
are means±S.E.M. for three to four independent experiments.
*P&lt;0.05, comparison of treated and untreated cells.

M6P/IGF2R-dependent formation of dense lysosomes is impaired by the simultaneous inactivation
of its two M6P-binding sites
To investigate the correlation between the expression of mutant M6P/IGF2R and the biogenesis of
lysosomes in SCC-VII cells, subcellular fractionation experiments by means of Percoll
density-gradient centrifugation were performed. The dense-gradient fractions of mock-transfected
SCC-VII cells contain only little HEX activity, as already previously reported for the parental cell
line [,,]. In SCC-VII cells expressing wt M6P/IGF2R, a much larger HEX
fraction (37–45%) was found to reside in compartments of high buoyant density, mimicking the
sedimentation behaviour of the enzyme in normal cells [].
The same was now observed for M6P/IGF2R Dom11mut cells, with 41% of the total HEX
activity detected in the high-density fractions of the gradient. The subcellular distributions of CD
and CL were also analysed. In SCC-VII cells expressing the wt receptor, 46–58% of all
cellular CD was detected in the high-density region of the gradient, whereas the accumulation of CL
in dense compartments was less pronounced (27–34%). Upon expression of M6P/IGF2R
Dom11mut, only slightly lower amounts of CD (33%) and CL (24%) were found in the
high-density gradient fractions. A pronounced accumulation of HEX (36%), CD (58%) and CL (18%) in
dense lysosomes was also observed for cells expressing M6P/IGF2R Dom9mut. In contrast,
M6P/IGF2R Dom3mut cells were found to store far less of their HEX (14–21%), CD
(5–12%) and CL (11–14%) in high-density compartments. Even less of the cellular
content of HEX (13–15%), CD (4–7%) and CL (8–13%) was present in the
high-density fractions of M6P/IGF2R Dom3/9mut cells, which resembles the sedimentation
pattern of these enzymes in parental cells (HEX, 16%; CD, 5%; and CL, 8%). These results show that
the capacity of M6P/IGF2R to mediate the formation of dense lysosomes in SCC-VII cells strongly
depends on the presence of a functional M6P-binding site within domain 3 ().

Subcellular fractionation of SCC-VII cells expressing mutant forms of M6P/IGF2R
Post-nuclear supernatants were subjected to Percoll density-gradient centrifugation. Fractions
1–3 (dense), 4–7 (intermediate) and 8–10 (light) were then pooled and assayed
for their HEX, CD and CL contents. Results are means±S.E.M. for 3–11 independent
experiments except for mock-transfected SCC-VII cells (individual results of two fractionations).
Markers for the Golgi apparatus (GM130) and the endoplasmic reticulum (PDI) were only detected in
the light-gradient fractions.

†CD and CL data from [].

Simultaneous mutation of both M6P-binding sites abolishes the anti-invasive activity of
M6P/IGF2R in SCC-VII cells
Parental SCC-VII cells display an invasive behaviour when seeded on Matrigel, a reconstituted
basement membrane []. These invasive properties can be
dampened by ectopic expression of wt M6P/IGF2R []. The
invasiveness of SCC-VII cells expressing M6P/IGF2R Dom11mut was 44–56% lower than
that of mock-transfectants, mirroring the effects of wt M6P/IGF2R expression (48–56%
reduction). These data provide strong evidence that the presence of a functional binding site for
IGF-II is not essential for the anti-invasive capacity of the receptor in SCC-VII cells ().

Invasive properties of SCC-VII cells expressing mutant forms of M6P/IGF2R
Matrigel invasion assays of SCC-VII cells expressing either wt or mutant M6P/IGF2R were performed
using conditioned medium of fibroblasts as a chemoattractant. Mock-transfected cells were analysed
in parallel. Parental SCC-VII cells were used as controls (set to 100%). Results are
means±S.E.M. for at least three independent experiments.
*P&lt;0.05, compared with the mock-transfected cells.

We have also analysed the impact of mutations within the M6P-binding sites on the anti-invasive
activity of M6P/IGF2R in SCC-VII cells. As compared with the mock-transfected SCC-VII cells, the
invasiveness of M6P/IGF2R Dom9mut cells is similarly reduced (by 61%) as that of SCC-VII
cells expressing the wt receptor. M6P/IGF2R Dom3mut expression reduced SCC-VII invasion
to a far lesser extent (4–32%), thus providing further evidence that the two M6P-binding
sites are not functionally equivalent. Importantly, M6P/IGF2R Dom3/9mut cells exhibited
nearly the same invasiveness as mock-transfected SCC-VII cells (≤7% reduction). These data
suggest that a functional M6P-binding site within domain 3 is fully sufficient to mediate the
anti-invasive properties of the receptor, whereas the M6P-binding site in domain 9 is less
effective. Inactivation of both binding sites abolishes the anti-invasive activity of M6P/IGF2R,
which suggests that M6P-modified ligands of the receptor play a key role in the migration of SCCs
cells across basement membranes ().

The M6P-binding site in domain 3 is of key importance for the growth-suppressive activities
of M6P/IGF2R in SCC-VII cells
We have reported previously that expression of wt M6P/IGF2R leads to reduced cell densities in
late-stage SCC-VII cultures []. To determine the impact of
mutant forms of M6P/IGF2R on SCC-VII growth, we followed the cell numbers of the respective cultures
over a period of 3 days. During the first 48 h, there were no striking differences
between the growth rates of the investigated cell lines. After 72 h of incubation, cultures
of SCC-VII cells expressing M6P/IGF2R Dom9mut were found to contain substantially fewer
cells than the controls. This phenotype was far less pronounced upon expression of the other
M6P-binding site mutants, indicating that M6P/IGF2R-mediated growth arrest depends strongly on the
M6P-binding site in domain 3. Interestingly, M6P/IGF2R Dom11mut was similarly ineffective
in suppressing the growth of late-stage SCC-VII cultures, suggesting that this activity of the
receptor also requires a functional binding site for IGF-II ( and Supplementary Table S3 at http://www.biochemj.org/bj/451/bj4510091add.htm).

In vitro growth of SCC-VII cells transfected with mutant M6P/IGF2R
cDNAs
SCC-VII cells expressing either wt or mutant M6P/IGF2R were grown for 72 h under standard
culture conditions prior to harvesting and cell number determination. Mock-transfected cells were
analysed in parallel. Parental SCC-VII cells were used as controls (set to 100%). Results are
means±S.E.M. for at least three independent experiments.
*P&lt;0.05, compared with the mock-transfected cells.

Previous studies have revealed that SCC-VII cells are capable of growing in an
anchorage-independent manner when cultured in a semi-solid medium. Although the M6P/IGF2R status did
not affect the efficiency of colony formation, colonies formed by SCC-VII cells expressing wt
M6P/IGF2R were found to be significantly smaller than those of mock-transfected and parental cells
[]. The same observations were now made for M6P/IGF2R
Dom11mut-expressing cells, demonstrating that interaction with IGF-II is not required for
M6P/IGF2R-mediated restriction of anchorage-independent growth. Interestingly, the median size of
colonies formed by M6P/IGF2R Dom3mut and Dom3/9mut transfectants was close to
that of parental and mock-transfected cells, whereas colonies of M6P/IGF2R
Dom9mut-producing cells were only slightly larger than those of SCC-VII cells expressing
the wt receptor ( and Supplementary Table S4 at
http://www.biochemj.org/bj/451/bj4510091add.htm). Taken together, these results indicate
that a functional M6P-binding site in domain 3 is important for the capacity of M6P/IGF2R to
decrease anchorage-independent growth of SCC-VII cells, thus providing further evidence for the
pivotal importance of this binding site for the cellular activities of the receptor.

Anchorage-independent growth of SCC-VII cells transfected with mutant M6P/IGF2R cDNAs
SCC-VII cells expressing either wt or mutant M6P/IGF2R were cultured for 3 weeks in
semi-solid medium before the median diameter of the colonies formed was determined. Mock-transfected
cells were analysed in parallel. Parental SCC-VII cells were used as controls (set to 100%). Results
are means±S.E.M. for at least three independent experiments.

DISCUSSION
It is currently believed that the functions of M6P/IGF2R in development and cancer suppression
rely mainly on its ability to control the biological activities of IGF-II. Indeed, substantial
evidence has been provided that the receptor down-regulates the growth-promoting and anti-apoptotic
effects of this potent mitogen, thus preventing developmental abnormalities and tumour formation
[,]. Recent
studies [–]
have highlighted that M6P/IGF2R also has the capacity to reduce cellular motility and invasiveness.
Whereas it has been originally suggested that this is related to altered IGF-II uptake and
degradation [], the anti-invasive activity of the receptor
has also been recently linked to its interactions with various proteinases [,]. To study the cellular impact of the
interactions between M6P/IGF2R and its diverse ligands separately, we have now introduced
inactivating mutations into the respective ligand-binding sites prior to stable expression of these
mutant receptor cDNAs in M6P/IGF2R-deficient SCC-VII cells, which respond to reconstitution of wt
M6P/IGF2R expression with compromized growth and invasiveness [].

To assess the biological activities of M6P/IGF2R independent of its interaction with IGF-II, we
have generated a receptor variant containing a point mutation within the IGF-II-binding site
(M6P/IGF2R Dom11mut). M6P/IGF2R Dom11mut was found to be less
growth-inhibitory than the wt receptor under standard culture conditions, in line with studies
performed on LNCaP and PC-3 human prostate cancer cells [].
However, this M6P/IGF2R mutant is still capable of restricting anchorage-independent growth of
SCC-VII cells. Moreover, M6P/IGF2R Dom11mut improves the intracellular accumulation of
lysosomal enzymes as efficiently as the wt receptor, thereby quantitatively restoring the formation
of dense lysosomes. Matrigel invasion assays revealed that M6P/IGF2R Dom11mut was
essentially as anti-invasive as the wt protein. Thus it can be concluded that a functional binding
site for IGF-II is not required for the anti-invasive activity of M6P/IGF2R in SCC-VII cells.

The impact of the M6P-binding activity of M6P/IGF2R on cellular growth, motility and invasiveness
has not yet been directly studied. However, some cancer-associated M6P/IGF2R mutations have been
found to reduce M6P binding [,]. To determine whether missense mutations in the two M6P-binding domains affect
the growth-inhibitory and anti-invasive activity of M6P/IGF2R, we have produced receptor variants
with inactivating point mutations within either of these binding sites. Ligand-binding studies
revealed that either of the single-mutant receptors is still able to bind M6P, whereas the
double-mutant receptor has lost this capacity. Although it has been reported that the two
M6P-binding sites of M6P/IGF2R can differ in their efficiencies of delivering individual acid
hydrolases to lysosomes [], the single mutants proved
almost equally effective in mediating the intracellular accumulation of HEX by SCC-VII cells. The
same observation was made for CD, but M6P/IGF2R Dom3mut was found to be better than
M6P/IGF2R Dom9mut in promoting the retention of CL. Secretion–recapture pathway
studies demonstrated that either single mutant matches wt M6P/IGF2R in its capacity to act in the
endocytic pathway. However, subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that M6P/IGF2R
Dom3mut is far less effective in promoting dense lysosome formation than M6P/IGF2R
Dom9mut and the wt receptor. This is possibly explained by the observation that some
lysosomal enzymes bind much tighter to domain 3 than to domain 9 [].

The double mutant M6P/IGF2R Dom3/9mut showed weak residual activity in delivering HEX
to lysosomes. This could be owing to the presence of an additional carbohydrate-binding site in
domain 5 of the receptor, which exhibits a distinct preference for the biosynthetic intermediate
M6P-N-acetylglucosamine []. It has been
reported that domain 5 is capable of mediating the endocytic uptake of a variant of recombinant acid
α-glucosidase enriched in such M6P diesters [].
However, inactivation of both M6P-binding sites almost completely abolished the capacity of the
receptor to perform reuptake of HEX secreted by SCC-VII cells. This is probably accounted for by the
high efficiency of these cells in uncovering phosphorylated N-glycans []. Furthermore, M6P/IGF2R Dom3/9mut was found to be
unable to support the generation of dense lysosomes in SCC-VII cells, suggesting that the
carbohydrate-binding site in domain 5 is also of minor importance for this activity of the
receptor.

We have previously reported that expression of wt M6P/IGF2R impedes the growth of SCC-VII cells
both in vitro and in vivo []. Analysis of SCC-VII cells expressing mutant receptors now revealed that the
M6P-binding site within domain 3 is more important for this activity than the one in domain 9.
M6P/IGF2R-mediated growth suppression was almost completely abolished by inactivation of both
domains, thus indicating that one or more M6P-modified protein(s) are, when secreted, capable of
promoting SCC-VII growth. One candidate for this would be the precursor of the lysosomal aspartic
proteinase CD, which has been recently shown to act as a paracrine communicator between cancer and
stromal cells in a manner independent of its proteolytic activity [,].

The anti-invasive potential of M6P/IGF2R forms lacking individual M6P-binding sites was assessed
by Matrigel invasion assays. Although M6P/IGF2R Dom9mut displayed essentially the same
anti-invasive behaviour as the wt receptor, M6P/IGF2R Dom3mut was found to be far less
effective. Importantly, simultaneous mutation of both M6P-binding sites abrogated the anti-invasive
activity of the receptor in SCC-VII cells. These results clearly demonstrate that certain
M6P-bearing factors are of substantial relevance for the extent of SCC-VII invasiveness. Thus lack
of functional M6P/IGF2R expression possibly favours cancer outgrowth and metastasis largely by
enhancing the release of M6P-modified proteins such as lysosomal proteinases and/or other acid
hydrolases into the extracellular space. This notion is corroborated by our previous observation
that the lysosomal cysteine proteinase cathepsin B contributes to the invasive properties of SCC-VII
cells []. Previous studies in transgenic mice have provided
compelling evidence for multiple functions of cysteine cathepsins such as cathepsin B and CL in
tumour invasion and metastasis [,,]. However, the impact of the M6P/IGF2R
status on the extracellular accumulation of CL in SCC-VII cultures is only moderate. Hence the
pro-invasive M6P-bearing protein(s) secreted by SCC-VII cells still remain to be identified.
